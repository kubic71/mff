You are given a representation of _(a, b)-tree_ with a `find` operation,
and a representation of an _(a, b)-tree node_.

Your goal is to implement an `insert` operation, which inserts the given
key in the tree (or does nothing if the key is already present).

You should submit the `ab_tree.*` file (but not `ab_tree_test.*` files).
