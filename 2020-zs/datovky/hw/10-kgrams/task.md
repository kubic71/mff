Your task is to write a function which takes a string and an integer K
and it reports how many different K-grams (K-character substrings) the
string has.

You are given an algorithm for construction of the suffix array. For
simplicity, this algorithm has time complexity $O(n \log^2 n)$. Except
for constructing the suffix array, your algorithm should run in linear
time.
