## CPU cache mapping (aliasing)

### 1. fully associative 
- every mem-block can be in every cache-line

```
|______32 bits________|
|_26b_tag_|_6b_offset_|
```

When data are cached in cache-line, corresponding tag is stored for addressing purposes
When data are being retrieved, tag of data being retrieved needs to be compared against every cache-line, 
implying O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of cache-lines

### 2. direct mapping 
- for each mem-block there is exactly 1 cache-line 
- example: cache 32kB => 512 64B cache-lines


|  | 32 bits |  |
-|-|-
17b tag | 9b index |  6b offset


Cache is an array of cache-lines without associated tags.
Index is basically direct pointer into the array.
Given address therefore has exactly 1 place where it can be stored, so no cache-strategy is needed 

### 3. set-associative mapping 
- every block can be in a given set of 2^i cache-lines
| | 32 bits | |
-|-|-
 (17+i)b tag | (9-i)b index |  6b offset

Cache is an array of 2^(9-i) sets of cache-lines, eache set is identified by the index and has cardinality 2^i,
so for every retrieval only 2^i tag comparisons need to be made.
