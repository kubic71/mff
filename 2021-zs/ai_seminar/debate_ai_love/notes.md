# Can Human fall in love with AI?

## Intro

### No
- AI is totally controllable, humans aren't
- AI is 100% loyal, and loses value as a result in the eye of a human
- love is a surprise, AI is designed
- current love business - transactional
	- true love - sacrifice


### Yes
- AI love possible, supposed the AI has most human traits, mimics human psyche
- Movies as evidence - Black mirror (and many more)
- AI doesn't have to be self-aware
- Humans are remixes of their friends and enviroments, AI personality can be mixed similarly
- game - **Detroit: Become Human**
- fundamental principle of liking - not hard
- humans can love psychopaths, who only fake it
	- fake-it-till-you-make-it AI should be doable
- goal - create self-conscious AI also capable of loving
- My Holo Love - people can settle for little (mere hologram)
	- we can do better

## Questions

###  To YES team
- How much independent would the AI have to be to earn respect and self-value?
	- should it have it's own (limited) rights?
- Does the AI need to be humanoid?


### To NO team
- is it necessary for the AI to be *uncontrollable, independent, rebelious, have it's own mind*?
	- people love dogs, and they obey
