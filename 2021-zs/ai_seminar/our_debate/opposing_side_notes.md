What is missing?
- today: 
    - designer gives insturction-set
- AI needs to find out on its own, where its knowledge is lacking
    - needs to decide, what problems to solve

- we give data, but don't give AI theories
    - AI only fitting the data


## Problem of Tacit knowledge
- understand human intuition



## NP hard problems
- humans cannot do that either


## World is non-linear, chaotic
- 


## Current State-of-the-art
- models selected by engineers, bound to be narrow


## AGI obstacles
- world is messy, complex, cannot be compressed reasonbly
- Moravec paradox
- causal knowledge
    - AI learn correlation, not causality, because cannot interact
- Asking why, what if? questions
- Chatbots fake-it
- needs to metacognition
- needs to self-improve


## Dreyfus
- humans has "common sense" knowledge, which you can gain only by living in the human culture
