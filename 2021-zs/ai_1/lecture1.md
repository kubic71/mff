| Human performance | ideal performance
thought process | Thinking humanly (cognitive science) | Thinking rationally (logic) 
Behaviour | acting humanly (behaviourism ) | acting rationally (doing the right thing)

## Acting humanly
- Alan Turing (1950)
    - Operational definition of intelligence
    - "Can machines think?"
    - Problem: defining thinking -> too hard -> "Can machines act intelligently" -> "Can machines act like a man"
    - **Turing test** (sumulation game)
        - Can a human interrogator tell a machine from a human
    - **Required capabilities**:
        - NLP
        - knowledge representation
        - automated reasoning
        - ability to learn (machine learning)
        - computer vision
        - robotics
- **Reverse turing test**
    - Computer telling machine from a man
    - ReCaptcha


## Thinking humanly
- *Cognitive modelling*
- modelling a human mind
- approaches:
    - Top-down (psychology)
        - following human reasoning steps through introspection and human observation
        - **GPS** 
    - Bottom-up (neuroscience)
        - modelling the brain (observing brain in action)
            - "enough neurons will give you intelligence"

## Thinking rationally
- rational agent
- Aristotle
    - Syllogisms
        - patterns for arguments
        - Socrates is a man, all men are mortal -> Socrates is mortal
        - beginnings of logic
- Major obsactles:
    - uncertainty
    - problem solving in principle vs. in practice
        - for example *Combinatorial explosion* - cannot search problemspace in reasonable time

## Acting rationally
- *Doing the right things*
- "right thing" - achieving the best (expected) outcome even in uncertainty
- making correct inferences - rational agent
    - in some situations - no provable correct thing to do, but something must still be done
    - reflex actions in time-limiting situations

- we concentrate on rational agents and on ways to construct them

### The history of AI
- gestation 1943-55 - Turing
- birth 1956 - Darthmouth workshop (Shannon, Minsky, J. McCarthy, Newell, Simon)
    - Logic theorists
- Great expectations 1952-69
    - passing multiple AI benchmarks
    - GPS (general problem solver), List (1958)
- Dose of reality 1966-73
- Expert systems 69-79 (rule-based)
    - PROLOG 1972
    - frames  (Minsky, 1975) - birth of OOP (object oriented programmign)
- AI becomes an industry (1980)
    - big money
    - then AI winter
- The return of neural-nets (1986)
    - revinventing the back-propagation
- AI becomes scientific (1987)
    - many scientific branches, fragmentation
- Emergence of intelligent agents (1995)
- Probabilistic reasoning (1987-present)
    - Bayesian networks, Hidden markov models
- Big data (2001-present)
- Deep learning (2011-present)
    - it's not the only AI
    - GPU, TPU, FPGA

- What's next?
    - Deep learning - another hype cycle
