WHEN
on
board
H
.
M
.
S
.
Beagle
as
naturalist
,
I
was
much
struck
with
certain
facts
in
the
distribution
of
the
organic
beings
inhabiting
South
America
,
and
in
the
geological
relations
of
the
present
to
the
past
inhabitants
of
that
continent
.
These
facts
,
as
will
be
seen
in
the
latter
chapters
of
this
volume
,
seemed
to
throw
some
light
on
the
origin
of
species
that
mystery
of
mysteries
,
as
it
has
been
called
by
one
of
our
greatest
philosophers
.
On
my
return
home
,
it
occurred
to
me
,
in
1837
,
that
something
might
perhaps
be
made
out
on
this
question
by
patiently
accumulating
and
reflecting
on
all
sorts
of
facts
which
could
possibly
have
any
bearing
on
it
.
After
five
years'
work
I
allowed
myself
to
speculate
on
the
subject
,
and
drew
up
some
short
notes
;
these
I
enlarged
in
1844
into
a
sketch
of
the
conclusions
,
which
then
seemed
to
me
probable
:
from
that
period
to
the
present
day
I
have
steadily
pursued
the
same
object
.
I
hope
that
I
may
be
excused
for
entering
on
these
personal
details
,
as
I
give
them
to
show
that
I
have
not
been
hasty
in
coming
to
a
decision
.
My
work
is
now
(
1859
)
nearly
finished
;
but
as
it
will
take
me
many
more
years
to
complete
it
,
and
as
my
health
is
far
from
strong
,
I
have
been
urged
to
publish
this
abstract
.
I
have
more
especially
been
induced
to
do
this
,
as
Mr
.
Wallace
,
who
is
now
studying
the
natural
history
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
,
has
arrived
at
almost
exactly
the
same
general
conclusions
that
I
have
on
the
origin
of
species
.
In
1858
he
sent
me
a
memoir
on
this
subject
,
with
a
request
that
I
would
forward
it
to
Sir
Charles
Lyell
,
who
sent
it
to
the
Linnean
Society
,
and
it
is
published
in
the
third
volume
of
the
Journal
of
that
society
.
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
Dr
.
Hooker
,
who
both
knew
of
my
work
the
latter
having
read
my
sketch
of
1844
honoured
me
by
thinking
it
advisable
to
publish
,
with
Mr
.
Wallace's
excellent
memoir
,
some
brief
extracts
from
my
manuscripts
.
This
abstract
,
which
I
now
publish
,
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
.
cannot
here
give
references
and
authorities
for
my
several
statements
;
and
I
must
trust
to
the
reader
reposing
some
confidence
in
my
accuracy
.
No
doubt
errors
will
have
crept
in
,
though
I
hope
I
have
always
been
cautious
in
trusting
to
good
authorities
alone
.
I
can
here
give
only
the
general
conclusions
at
which
I
have
arrived
,
with
a
few
facts
in
illustration
,
but
which
,
I
hope
,
in
most
cases
will
suffice
.
No
one
can
feel
more
sensible
than
I
do
of
the
necessity
of
hereafter
publishing
in
detail
all
the
facts
,
with
references
,
on
which
my
conclusions
have
been
grounded
;
and
I
hope
in
a
future
work
to
do
this
.
For
I
am
well
aware
that
scarcely
a
single
point
is
discussed
in
this
volume
on
which
facts
cannot
be
adduced
,
often
apparently
leading
to
conclusions
directly
opposite
to
those
at
which
I
have
arrived
.
A
fair
result
can
be
obtained
only
by
fully
stating
and
balancing
the
facts
and
arguments
on
both
sides
of
each
question
;
and
this
is
here
impossible
.
I
much
regret
that
want
of
space
prevents
my
having
the
satisfaction
of
acknowledging
the
generous
assistance
which
I
have
received
from
very
many
naturalists
,
some
of
them
personally
unknown
to
me
.
I
cannot
,
however
,
let
this
opportunity
pass
without
expressing
my
deep
obligations
to
Dr
.
Hooker
,
who
,
for
the
last
fifteen
years
,
has
aided
me
in
every
possible
way
by
his
large
stores
of
knowledge
and
his
excellent
judgment
.
In
considering
the
Origin
of
Species
,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
naturalist
,
reflecting
on
the
mutual
affinities
of
organic
beings
,
on
their
embryological
relations
,
their
geographical
distribution
,
geological
succession
,
and
other
such
facts
,
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
species
had
not
been
independently
created
,
but
had
descended
,
like
varieties
,
from
other
species
.
Nevertheless
,
such
a
conclusion
,
even
if
well
founded
,
would
be
unsatisfactory
,
until
it
could
be
shown
how
the
innumerable
species
inhabiting
this
world
have
been
modified
,
so
as
to
acquire
that
perfection
of
structure
and
coadaptation
which
justly
excites
our
admiration
.
Naturalists
continually
refer
to
external
conditions
,
such
as
climate
,
food
,
&c
.
,
as
the
only
possible
cause
of
variation
.
In
one
limited
sense
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
this
may
be
true
;
but
it
is
preposterous
to
attribute
to
mere
external
conditions
,
the
structure
,
for
instance
,
of
the
woodpecker
,
with
its
feet
,
tail
,
beak
,
and
tongue
,
so
admirably
adapted
to
catch
insects
under
the
bark
of
trees
.
In
the
case
of
the
mistletoe
,
which
draws
its
nourishment
from
certain
trees
,
which
has
seeds
that
must
be
transported
by
certain
birds
,
and
which
has
flowers
with
separate
sexes
absolutely
requiring
the
agency
of
certain
insects
to
bring
pollen
from
one
flower
to
the
other
,
it
is
equally
preposterous
to
account
for
the
structure
of
this
parasite
,
with
its
relations
to
several
distinct
organic
beings
,
by
the
effects
of
external
conditions
,
or
of
habit
,
or
of
the
volition
of
the
plant
itself
.
It
is
,
therefore
,
of
the
highest
importance
to
gain
a
clear
insight
into
the
means
of
modification
and
coadaptation
.
At
the
commencement
of
my
observations
it
seemed
to
me
probable
that
a
careful
study
of
domesticated
animals
and
of
cultivated
plants
would
offer
the
best
chance
of
making
out
this
obscure
problem
.
Nor
have
I
been
disappointed
;
in
this
and
in
all
other
perplexing
cases
I
have
invariably
found
that
our
knowledge
,
imperfect
though
it
be
,
of
variation
under
domestication
,
afforded
the
best
and
safest
clue
.
I
may
venture
to
express
my
conviction
of
the
high
value
of
such
studies
,
although
they
have
been
very
commonly
neglected
by
naturalists
.
From
these
considerations
,
I
shall
devote
the
first
chapter
of
this
Abstract
to
Variation
under
Domestication
.
We
shall
thus
see
that
a
large
amount
of
hereditary
modification
is
at
least
possible
;
and
,
what
is
equally
or
more
important
,
we
shall
see
how
great
is
the
power
of
man
in
accumulating
by
his
Selection
successive
slight
variations
.
I
will
then
pass
on
to
the
variability
of
species
in
a
state
of
nature
;
but
I
shall
,
unfortunately
,
be
compelled
to
treat
this
subject
far
too
briefly
,
as
it
can
be
treated
properly
only
by
giving
long
catalogues
of
facts
.
We
shall
,
however
,
be
enabled
to
discuss
what
circumstances
are
most
favourable
to
variation
.
In
the
next
chapter
the
Struggle
for
Existence
amongst
all
organic
beings
throughout
the
world
,
which
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
geometrical
ratio
of
their
increase
,
will
be
considered
.
This
is
the
doctrine
of
Malthus
,
applied
to
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
.
As
many
more
individuals
of
each
species
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
;
and
as
,
consequently
,
there
is
a
frequently
recurring
struggle
for
existence
,
it
follows
that
any
being
,
if
it
vary
however
slightly
in
any
manner
profitable
to
itself
,
under
the
complex
and
sometimes
varying
conditions
of
life
,
will
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
,
and
thus
be
naturally
selected
.
From
the
strong
principle
of
inheritance
,
any
selected
variety
will
tend
to
propagate
its
new
and
modified
form
.
This
fundamental
subject
of
Natural
Selection
will
be
treated
at
some
length
in
the
fourth
chapter
;
and
we
shall
then
see
how
Natural
Selection
almost
inevitably
causes
much
Extinction
of
the
less
improved
forms
of
life
,
and
leads
to
what
I
have
called
Divergence
of
Character
.
In
the
next
chapter
I
shall
discuss
the
complex
and
little
known
laws
of
variation
.
In
the
five
succeeding
chapters
,
the
most
apparent
and
gravest
difficulties
in
accepting
the
theory
will
be
given
:
namely
,
first
,
the
difficulties
of
transitions
,
or
how
a
simple
being
or
a
simple
organ
can
be
changed
and
perfected
into
a
highly
developed
being
or
into
an
elaborately
constructed
organ
;
secondly
,
the
subject
of
Instinct
,
or
the
mental
powers
of
animals
;
thirdly
,
Hybridism
,
or
the
infertility
of
species
and
the
fertility
of
varieties
when
intercrossed
;
and
fourthly
,
the
imperfection
of
the
Geological
Record
.
In
the
next
chapter
I
shall
consider
the
geological
succession
of
organic
beings
throughout
time
;
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
,
their
geographical
distribution
throughout
space
;
in
the
fourteenth
,
their
classification
or
mutual
affinities
,
both
when
mature
and
in
an
embryonic
condition
.
In
the
last
chapter
I
shall
give
a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
whole
work
,
and
a
few
concluding
remarks
.
No
one
ought
to
feel
surprise
at
much
remaining
as
yet
unexplained
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
species
and
varieties
,
if
he
make
due
allowance
for
our
profound
ignorance
in
regard
to
the
mutual
relations
of
the
many
beings
which
live
around
us
.
Who
can
explain
why
one
species
ranges
widely
and
is
very
numerous
,
and
why
another
allied
species
has
a
narrow
range
and
is
rare
?
Yet
these
relations
are
of
the
highest
importance
,
for
they
determine
the
present
welfare
and
,
as
I
believe
,
the
future
success
and
modification
of
every
inhabitant
of
this
world
.
Still
less
do
we
know
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
innumerable
inhabitants
of
the
world
during
the
many
past
geological
epochs
in
its
history
.
Although
much
remains
obscure
,
and
will
long
remain
obscure
,
I
can
entertain
no
doubt
,
after
the
most
deliberate
study
and
dispassionate
judgment
of
which
I
am
capable
,
that
the
view
which
most
naturalists
until
recently
entertained
,
and
which
I
formerly
entertained
namely
,
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
is
erroneous
.
I
am
fully
convinced
that
species
are
not
immutable
;
but
that
those
belonging
to
what
are
called
the
same
genera
are
lineal
descendants
of
some
other
and
generally
extinct
species
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
acknowledged
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
the
descendants
of
that
species
.
Furthermore
,
I
am
convinced
that
Natural
Selection
has
been
the
most
important
,
but
not
the
exclusive
,
means
of
modification
.
CHAPTER
I
VARIATION
UNDER
DOMESTICATION
Causes
of
Variability
WHEN
we
compare
the
individuals
of
the
same
variety
or
sub
variety
of
our
older
cultivated
plants
and
animals
,
one
of
the
first
points
which
strikes
us
is
,
that
they
generally
differ
more
from
each
other
than
do
the
individuals
of
any
one
species
or
variety
in
a
state
of
nature
.
And
if
we
reflect
on
the
vast
diversity
of
the
plants
and
animals
which
have
been
cultivated
,
and
which
have
varied
during
all
ages
under
the
most
different
climates
and
treatment
,
we
are
driven
to
conclude
that
this
great
variability
is
due
to
our
domestic
productions
having
been
raised
under
conditions
of
life
not
so
uniform
as
,
and
somewhat
different
from
,
those
to
which
the
parent
species
had
been
exposed
under
nature
.
There
is
,
also
,
some
probability
in
the
view
propounded
by
Andrew
Knight
,
that
this
variability
may
be
partly
connected
with
excess
of
food
.
It
seems
clear
that
organic
beings
must
be
exposed
during
several
generations
to
new
conditions
to
cause
any
great
amount
of
variation
;
and
that
,
when
the
organisation
has
once
begun
to
vary
,
it
generally
continues
varying
for
many
generations
.
No
case
is
on
record
of
a
variable
organism
ceasing
to
vary
under
cultivation
.
Our
oldest
cultivated
plants
,
such
as
wheat
,
still
yield
new
varieties
:
our
oldest
,
domesticated
animals
are
still
capable
of
rapid
improvement
or
modification
.
As
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
,
after
long
attending
to
the
subject
,
the
conditions
of
life
appear
to
act
in
two
ways
,
directly
on
the
whole
organisation
or
on
certain
parts
alone
,
and
indirectly
by
affecting
the
reproductive
system
.
With
respect
to
the
direct
action
,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
every
case
,
as
Professor
Weismann
has
lately
insisted
,
and
as
I
have
incidentally
shown
in
my
work
on
Variation
under
Domestication
,
there
are
two
factors
:
namely
,
the
nature
of
the
organism
,
and
the
nature
of
the
conditions
.
The
former
seems
to
be
much
the
more
important
;
for
nearly
similar
variations
sometimes
arise
under
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
dissimilar
conditions
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
dissimilar
variations
arise
under
conditions
which
appear
to
be
nearly
uniform
.
The
effects
on
the
offspring
are
either
definite
or
indefinite
.
They
may
be
considered
as
definite
when
all
or
nearly
all
the
offspring
of
individuals
exposed
to
certain
conditions
during
several
generations
are
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
It
is
extremely
difficult
to
come
to
any
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
extent
of
the
changes
which
have
been
thus
definitely
induced
.
There
can
,
however
,
be
little
doubt
about
many
slight
changes
,
such
as
size
from
the
amount
of
food
,
colour
from
the
nature
of
the
food
,
thickness
of
the
skin
and
hair
from
climate
,
&c
.
Each
of
the
endless
variations
which
we
see
in
the
plumage
of
our
fowls
must
have
had
some
efficient
cause
;
and
if
the
same
cause
were
to
act
uniformly
during
a
long
series
of
generations
on
.
many
individuals
,
all
probably
would
be
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
Such
facts
as
the
complex
and
extraordinary
out
growths
which
variably
follow
from
the
insertion
of
a
minute
drop
of
poison
by
a
gall
producing
insect
,
show
us
what
singular
modifications
might
result
in
the
case
of
plants
from
a
chemical
change
in
the
nature
of
the
sap
.
Indefinite
variability
is
a
much
more
common
result
of
changed
conditions
than
definite
variability
,
and
has
probably
played
a
more
important
part
in
the
formation
of
our
domestic
races
.
We
see
indefinite
variability
in
the
endless
slight
peculiarities
which
distinguish
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
which
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
inheritance
from
either
parent
or
from
some
more
remote
ancestor
.
Even
strongly
marked
differences
occasionally
appear
in
the
young
of
the
same
litter
,
and
in
seedlings
from
the
same
seed
capsule
.
At
long
intervals
of
time
,
out
of
millions
of
individuals
reared
in
the
same
country
and
fed
on
nearly
the
same
food
,
deviations
of
structure
so
strongly
pronounced
as
to
deserve
to
be
called
monstrosities
arise
;
but
monstrosities
cannot
be
separated
by
any
distinct
line
from
slighter
variations
.
All
such
changes
of
structure
,
whether
extremely
slight
or
strongly
marked
,
which
appear
amongst
many
individuals
living
together
,
may
be
considered
as
the
indefinite
effects
of
the
conditions
of
life
on
each
individual
organism
,
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
the
chill
affects
different
men
in
an
indefinite
manner
,
according
to
their
state
of
body
or
constitution
,
causing
coughs
or
colds
,
rheumatism
,
or
inflammation
of
various
organs
.
With
respect
to
what
I
have
called
the
indirect
action
of
changed
conditions
,
namely
,
through
the
reproductive
system
of
being
affected
,
we
may
infer
that
variability
is
thus
induced
,
partly
from
the
fact
of
this
system
being
extremely
sensitive
to
any
change
in
the
conditions
,
and
partly
from
the
similarity
,
as
Kreuter
and
others
have
remarked
,
between
the
variability
which
follows
from
the
crossing
of
distinct
species
,
and
that
which
may
be
observed
with
plants
and
animals
when
reared
under
new
or
unnatural
conditions
.
Many
facts
clearly
show
how
eminently
susceptible
the
reproductive
system
is
to
very
slight
changes
in
the
surrounding
conditions
.
Nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
tame
an
animal
,
and
few
things
more
difficult
than
to
get
it
to
breed
freely
under
confinement
,
even
when
the
male
and
female
unite
.
How
many
animals
there
are
which
will
not
breed
,
though
kept
in
an
almost
free
state
in
their
native
country!
This
is
generally
,
but
erroneously
,
attributed
to
vitiated
instincts
.
Many
cultivated
plants
display
the
utmost
vigour
,
and
yet
rarely
or
never
seed!
In
some
few
cases
it
has
been
discovered
that
a
very
trifling
change
,
such
as
a
little
more
or
less
water
at
some
particular
period
of
growth
,
will
determine
whether
or
not
a
plant
will
produce
seeds
.
I
cannot
here
give
the
details
which
I
have
collected
and
elsewhere
published
on
this
curious
subject
;
but
to
show
how
singular
the
laws
are
which
determine
the
reproduction
of
animals
under
confinement
,
I
may
mention
that
carnivorous
animals
,
even
from
the
tropics
,
breed
in
this
country
pretty
freely
under
confinement
,
with
the
exception
of
the
plantigrades
or
bear
family
,
which
seldom
produce
young
;
whereas
carnivorous
birds
,
with
the
rarest
exceptions
,
hardly
ever
lay
fertile
eggs
.
Many
exotic
plants
have
pollen
utterly
worthless
,
in
the
same
condition
as
in
the
most
sterile
hybrids
.
When
,
on
the
one
hand
,
we
see
domesticated
animals
and
plants
,
though
often
weak
and
sickly
,
breeding
freely
under
confinement
;
and
when
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
see
individuals
,
though
taken
young
from
a
state
of
nature
perfectly
tamed
,
long
lived
and
healthy
(
of
which
I
could
give
numerous
instances
)
,
yet
having
their
reproductive
system
so
seriously
affected
by
unperceived
causes
as
to
fail
to
act
,
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
system
,
when
it
does
act
under
confinement
,
acting
irregularly
,
and
producing
offspring
somewhat
unlike
their
parents
.
I
may
add
,
that
as
some
organisms
breed
freely
under
the
most
unnatural
conditions
(
for
instance
,
rabbits
and
ferrets
kept
in
hutches
)
,
showing
that
their
reproductive
organs
are
not
easily
affected
;
so
will
some
animals
and
plants
withstand
domestication
or
cultivation
,
and
vary
very
slightly
perhaps
hardly
more
than
in
a
state
of
nature
.
Some
naturalists
have
maintained
that
all
variations
are
connected
with
the
act
of
sexual
reproduction
;
but
this
is
certainly
an
error
;
for
I
have
given
in
another
work
a
long
list
of
"
sporting
plants
,
"
as
they
are
called
by
gardeners
;
that
is
,
of
plants
which
have
suddenly
produced
a
single
bud
with
a
new
and
sometimes
widely
different
character
from
that
of
the
other
buds
on
the
same
plant
.
These
bud
variations
,
as
they
may
be
named
,
can
be
propagated
by
grafts
,
offsets
,
&c
.
,
and
sometimes
by
seed
.
They
occur
rarely
under
nature
,
but
are
far
from
rare
under
culture
.
As
a
single
bud
out
of
the
many
thousands
,
produced
year
after
year
on
the
same
tree
under
uniform
conditions
,
has
been
known
suddenly
to
assume
a
new
character
;
and
as
buds
on
distinct
trees
,
growing
under
different
conditions
,
have
sometimes
yielded
nearly
the
same
variety
for
instance
,
buds
on
peach
trees
producing
nectarines
,
and
buds
on
common
roses
producing
moss
roses
we
clearly
see
that
the
nature
of
the
conditions
is
of
subordinate
importance
in
comparison
with
the
nature
of
the
organism
in
determining
each
particular
form
of
variation
;
perhaps
of
not
more
importance
than
the
nature
of
the
spark
,
by
which
a
mass
of
combustible
matter
is
ignited
,
has
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
flames
.
Effects
of
Habit
and
of
the
Use
or
Disuse
of
Parts
;
Correlated
Variation
;
Inheritance
Changed
habits
produce
an
inherited
effect
,
as
in
the
period
of
the
flowering
of
plants
when
transported
from
one
climate
to
another
.
With
animals
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
has
had
a
more
marked
influence
;
thus
I
find
in
the
domestic
duck
that
the
bones
of
the
wing
weigh
less
and
the
bones
of
the
leg
more
,
in
proportion
to
the
whole
skeleton
,
than
do
the
same
bones
in
the
wild
duck
;
and
this
change
may
be
safely
attributed
to
the
domestic
duck
flying
much
less
,
and
walking
more
,
than
its
wild
parents
.
The
great
and
inherited
development
of
the
udders
in
cows
and
goats
in
countries
where
they
are
habitually
milked
,
in
comparison
with
these
organs
in
other
countries
,
is
probably
another
instance
of
the
effects
of
use
.
Not
one
of
our
domestic
animals
can
be
named
which
has
not
in
some
country
drooping
ears
;
and
the
view
which
has
been
suggested
that
the
drooping
is
due
to
disuse
of
the
muscles
of
the
ear
,
from
the
animals
being
seldom
much
alarmed
,
seems
probable
.
Many
laws
regulate
variation
,
some
few
of
which
can
be
dimly
seen
,
and
will
hereafter
be
briefly
discussed
.
I
will
here
only
allude
to
what
may
be
called
correlated
variation
.
Important
changes
in
the
embryo
or
larva
will
probably
entail
changes
in
the
mature
animal
.
In
monstrosities
,
the
correlations
between
quite
distinct
parts
are
very
curious
;
and
many
instances
are
given
in
Isidore
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire's
great
work
on
this
subject
.
Breeders
believe
that
long
limbs
are
almost
always
accompanied
by
an
elongated
head
.
Some
instances
of
correlation
are
quite
whimsical
:
thus
cats
which
are
entirely
white
and
have
blue
eyes
are
generally
deaf
;
but
it
has
been
lately
stated
by
Mr
.
Tait
that
this
is
confined
to
the
males
.
Colour
and
constitutional
peculiarities
go
together
,
of
which
many
remarkable
cases
could
be
given
amongst
animals
and
plants
.
From
facts
collected
by
Heusinger
,
it
appears
that
white
sheep
and
pigs
are
injured
by
certain
plants
,
whilst
dark
coloured
individuals
escape
:
Professor
Wyman
has
recently
communicated
to
me
a
good
illustration
of
this
fact
;
on
asking
some
farmers
in
Virginia
how
it
was
that
all
their
pigs
were
black
,
they
informed
him
that
the
pigs
ate
the
paint
root
(
Lachnanthes
)
,
which
coloured
their
bones
pink
,
and
which
caused
the
hoofs
of
all
but
the
black
varieties
to
drop
off
;
and
one
of
the
"
crackers
"
(
i
.
e
.
Virginia
squatters
)
added
,
"
we
select
the
black
members
of
a
litter
for
raising
,
as
they
alone
have
a
good
chance
of
living
.
"
Hairless
dogs
have
imperfect
teeth
;
long
haired
and
coarse
haired
animals
are
apt
to
have
,
as
is
asserted
,
long
or
many
horns
;
pigeons
with
feathered
feet
have
skin
between
their
outer
toes
;
pigeons
with
short
beaks
have
small
feet
,
and
those
with
long
beaks
large
feet
.
Hence
if
man
goes
on
selecting
,
and
thus
augmenting
,
any
peculiarity
,
he
will
almost
certainly
modify
unintentionally
other
parts
of
the
structure
,
owing
to
the
mysterious
laws
of
correlation
.
The
results
of
the
various
,
unknown
,
or
but
dimly
understood
laws
of
variation
are
infinitely
complex
and
diversified
.
It
is
well
worth
while
carefully
to
study
the
several
treatises
on
some
of
our
old
cultivated
plants
,
as
on
the
hyacinth
,
potato
,
even
the
dahlia
,
&c
.
;
and
it
is
really
surprising
to
note
the
endless
points
of
structure
and
constitution
in
which
the
varieties
and
sub
varieties
differ
slightly
from
each
other
.
The
whole
organisation
seems
to
have
become
plastic
,
and
departs
in
a
slight
degree
from
that
of
the
parental
type
.
Any
variation
which
is
not
inherited
is
unimportant
for
us
.
But
the
number
and
diversity
of
inheritable
deviations
of
structure
,
both
those
of
slight
and
those
of
considerable
physiological
importance
,
are
endless
.
Dr
.
Prosper
Lucas's
treatise
,
in
two
large
volumes
,
is
the
fullest
and
the
best
on
this
subject
.
No
breeder
doubts
how
strong
is
the
tendency
to
inheritance
;
that
like
produces
like
is
his
fundamental
belief
:
doubts
have
been
thrown
on
this
principle
only
by
theoretical
writers
.
When
any
deviation
of
structure
often
appears
,
and
we
see
it
in
the
father
and
child
,
we
cannot
tell
whether
it
may
not
be
due
to
the
same
cause
having
acted
on
both
;
but
when
amongst
individuals
,
apparently
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
,
any
very
rare
deviation
,
due
to
some
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances
,
appears
in
the
parent
say
,
once
amongst
several
million
individuals
and
it
reappears
in
the
child
,
the
mere
doctrine
of
chances
almost
compels
us
to
attribute
its
reappearance
to
inheritance
.
Every
one
must
have
heard
of
cases
of
albinism
,
prickly
skin
,
hairy
bodies
,
&c
.
,
appearing
in
several
members
of
the
same
family
.
If
strange
and
rare
deviations
of
structure
are
really
inherited
,
less
strange
and
commoner
deviations
may
be
freely
admitted
to
be
inheritable
.
Perhaps
the
correct
way
of
viewing
the
whole
subject
would
be
,
to
look
at
the
inheritance
of
every
character
whatever
as
the
rule
,
and
non
inheritance
as
the
anomaly
?
The
laws
governing
inheritance
are
for
the
most
part
unknown
.
No
one
can
say
why
the
same
peculiarity
in
different
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
or
in
different
species
,
is
sometimes
inherited
and
sometimes
not
so
;
why
the
child
often
reverts
in
certain
characters
to
its
grandfather
or
grandmother
or
more
remote
ancestor
;
why
a
peculiarity
is
often
transmitted
from
one
sex
to
both
sexes
,
or
to
one
sex
alone
,
more
commonly
but
not
exclusively
to
the
like
sex
.
It
is
a
fact
of
some
importance
to
us
,
that
peculiarities
appearing
in
the
males
of
our
domestic
breeds
are
often
transmitted
,
either
exclusively
or
in
a
much
greater
degree
,
to
the
males
alone
.
A
much
more
important
rule
,
which
I
think
may
be
trusted
,
is
that
,
at
whatever
period
of
life
a
peculiarity
first
appears
,
it
tends
to
reappear
in
the
offspring
at
a
corresponding
age
,
though
sometimes
earlier
.
In
many
cases
this
could
not
be
otherwise
;
thus
the
inherited
peculiarities
in
the
horns
of
cattle
could
appear
only
in
the
offspring
when
nearly
mature
;
peculiarities
in
the
silkworm
are
known
to
appear
at
the
corresponding
caterpillar
or
cocoon
stage
.
But
hereditary
diseases
and
some
other
facts
make
me
believe
that
the
rule
has
a
wider
extension
,
and
that
,
when
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
a
peculiarity
should
appear
at
any
particular
age
,
yet
that
it
does
tend
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period
at
which
it
first
appeared
in
the
parent
.
I
believe
this
rule
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
in
explaining
the
laws
of
embryology
.
These
remarks
are
of
course
confined
to
the
first
appearance
of
the
peculiarity
,
and
not
to
the
primary
cause
which
may
have
acted
on
the
ovules
or
on
the
male
element
;
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
the
increased
length
of
the
horns
in
the
offspring
from
a
short
horned
cow
by
a
long
horned
bull
,
though
appearing
late
in
life
,
is
clearly
due
to
the
male
element
.
Having
alluded
to
the
subject
of
reversion
,
I
may
here
refer
to
a
statement
often
made
by
naturalists
namely
,
that
our
domestic
varieties
,
when
run
wild
,
gradually
but
invariably
revert
in
character
to
their
aboriginal
stocks
.
Hence
it
has
been
argued
that
no
deductions
can
be
drawn
from
domestic
races
to
species
in
a
state
of
nature
.
I
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
discover
on
what
decisive
facts
the
above
statement
has
so
often
and
so
boldly
been
made
.
There
would
be
great
difficulty
in
proving
its
truth
:
we
may
safely
conclude
that
very
many
of
the
most
strongly
marked
domestic
varieties
could
not
possibly
live
in
a
wild
state
.
In
many
cases
,
we
do
not
know
what
the
aboriginal
stock
was
,
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
nearly
perfect
reversion
had
ensued
.
It
would
be
necessary
,
in
order
to
prevent
the
effects
of
intercrossing
,
that
only
a
single
variety
should
have
been
turned
loose
in
its
new
home
.
Nevertheless
,
as
our
varieties
certainly
do
occasionally
revert
in
some
of
their
characters
to
ancestral
forms
,
it
seems
to
me
not
improbable
that
if
we
could
succeed
in
naturalising
,
or
were
to
cultivate
,
during
many
generations
,
the
several
races
,
for
instance
,
of
the
cabbage
,
in
very
poor
soil
(
in
which
case
,
however
,
some
effect
would
have
to
be
attributed
to
the
definite
action
of
the
poor
soil
)
,
that
they
would
,
to
a
large
extent
,
or
even
wholly
,
revert
to
the
wild
aboriginal
stock
.
Whether
or
not
the
experiment
would
succeed
,
is
not
of
great
importance
for
our
line
of
argument
;
for
by
the
experiment
itself
the
conditions
of
life
are
changed
.
If
it
could
be
shown
that
our
domestic
varieties
manifested
a
strong
tendency
to
reversion
,
that
is
,
to
lose
their
acquired
characters
,
whilst
kept
under
the
same
conditions
,
and
whilst
kept
in
a
considerable
body
,
so
that
free
intercrossing
might
check
,
by
blending
together
,
any
slight
deviations
in
their
structure
,
in
such
case
,
I
grant
that
we
could
deduce
nothing
from
domestic
varieties
in
regard
to
species
.
But
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
in
favour
of
this
view
:
to
assert
that
we
could
not
breed
our
cart
and
race
horses
,
long
and
short
horned
cattle
,
and
poultry
of
various
breeds
,
and
esculent
vegetables
,
for
an
unlimited
number
of
generations
,
would
be
opposed
to
all
experience
.
Character
of
Domestic
Varieties
;
Difficulty
of
distinguishing
between
Varieties
and
Species
;
Origin
of
Domestic
Varieties
from
one
or
more
Species
When
we
look
to
the
hereditary
varieties
or
races
of
our
domestic
animals
and
plants
,
and
compare
them
with
closely
allied
species
,
we
generally
perceive
in
each
domestic
race
,
as
already
remarked
,
less
uniformity
of
character
than
in
true
species
.
Domestic
races
often
have
a
somewhat
monstrous
character
;
by
which
I
mean
,
that
,
although
differing
from
each
other
,
and
from
other
species
of
the
same
genus
,
in
several
trifling
respects
,
they
often
differ
in
an
extreme
degree
in
some
one
part
,
both
when
compared
one
with
another
,
and
more
especially
when
compared
with
the
species
under
nature
to
which
they
are
nearest
allied
.
With
these
exceptions
(
and
with
that
of
the
perfect
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed
,
a
subject
hereafter
to
be
discussed
)
,
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
differ
from
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
do
the
closely
allied
species
of
the
same
genus
in
a
state
of
nature
,
but
the
differences
in
most
cases
are
less
in
degree
.
This
must
be
admitted
as
true
,
for
the
domestic
races
of
many
animals
and
plants
have
been
ranked
by
some
competent
judges
as
the
descendants
of
aboriginally
distinct
species
,
and
by
other
competent
judges
as
mere
varieties
.
If
any
well
marked
distinction
existed
between
a
domestic
race
and
a
species
,
this
source
of
doubt
would
not
so
perpetually
recur
.
It
has
often
been
stated
that
domestic
races
do
not
differ
from
each
other
in
character
of
generic
value
.
It
can
be
shown
that
this
statement
is
not
correct
;
but
naturalists
differ
much
in
determining
what
characters
are
of
generic
value
;
all
such
valuations
being
at
present
empirical
.
When
it
is
explained
how
genera
originate
under
nature
,
it
will
be
seen
that
we
have
no
right
to
expect
often
to
find
a
generic
amount
of
difference
in
our
domesticated
races
.
In
attempting
to
estimate
the
amount
of
structural
difference
between
allied
domestic
races
,
we
are
soon
involved
in
doubt
,
from
not
knowing
whether
they
are
descended
from
one
or
several
parent
species
.
This
point
,
if
it
could
be
cleared
up
,
would
be
interesting
;
if
,
for
instance
,
it
could
be
shown
that
the
greyhound
,
bloodhound
,
terrier
,
spaniel
,
and
bull
dog
,
which
we
all
know
propagate
their
kind
truly
,
were
the
offspring
of
any
single
species
,
then
such
facts
would
have
great
weight
in
making
us
doubt
about
the
immutability
of
the
many
closely
allied
natural
species
for
instance
,
of
the
many
foxes
inhabiting
different
quarters
of
the
world
.
I
do
not
believe
,
as
we
shall
presently
see
,
that
the
whole
amount
of
difference
between
the
several
breeds
of
the
dog
has
been
produced
under
domestication
;
I
believe
that
a
small
part
of
the
difference
is
due
to
their
being
descended
from
distinct
species
.
In
the
case
of
strongly
marked
races
of
some
other
domesticated
species
,
there
is
presumptive
or
even
strong
evidence
,
that
all
are
descended
from
a
single
wild
stock
.
It
has
often
been
assumed
that
man
has
chosen
for
domestication
animals
and
plants
having
an
extraordinary
inherent
tendency
to
vary
,
and
likewise
to
withstand
diverse
climates
.
I
do
not
dispute
that
these
capacities
have
added
largely
to
the
value
of
most
of
our
domesticated
productions
:
but
how
could
a
savage
possibly
know
,
when
he
first
tamed
an
animal
,
whether
it
would
vary
in
succeeding
generations
,
and
whether
it
would
endure
other
climates
?
Has
the
little
variability
of
the
ass
and
goose
,
or
the
small
power
of
endurance
of
warmth
by
the
reindeer
,
or
of
cold
by
the
common
camel
,
prevented
their
domestication
?
I
cannot
doubt
that
if
other
animals
and
plants
,
equal
in
number
to
our
domesticated
productions
,
and
belonging
to
equally
diverse
classes
and
countries
,
were
taken
from
a
state
of
nature
,
and
could
be
made
to
breed
for
an
equal
number
of
generations
under
domestication
,
they
would
on
an
average
vary
as
largely
as
the
parent
species
of
our
existing
domesticated
productions
have
varied
.
In
the
case
of
most
of
our
anciently
domesticated
animals
and
plants
,
it
is
not
possible
to
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
,
whether
they
are
descended
from
one
or
several
wild
species
.
The
argument
mainly
relied
on
by
those
who
believe
in
the
multiple
origin
of
our
domestic
animals
is
,
that
we
find
in
the
most
ancient
times
,
on
the
monuments
of
Egypt
,
and
in
the
lake
habitations
of
Switzerland
,
much
diversity
in
the
breeds
;
and
that
some
of
these
ancient
breeds
closely
resemble
,
or
are
even
identical
with
,
those
still
existing
.
But
this
only
throws
far
backwards
the
history
of
civilisation
,
and
shows
that
animals
were
domesticated
at
a
much
earlier
period
than
has
hitherto
been
supposed
.
The
lake
inhabitants
of
Switzerland
cultivated
several
kinds
of
wheat
and
barley
,
the
pea
,
the
poppy
for
oil
,
and
flax
;
and
they
possessed
several
domesticated
animals
.
They
also
carried
on
commerce
with
other
nations
.
All
this
clearly
shows
,
as
Reer
has
remarked
,
that
they
had
at
this
early
age
progressed
considerably
in
civilisation
;
and
this
again
implies
a
long
continued
previous
period
of
less
advanced
civilisation
,
during
which
the
domesticated
animals
,
kept
by
different
tribes
in
different
districts
,
might
have
varied
and
given
rise
to
distinct
races
.
Since
the
discovery
of
flint
tools
in
the
superficial
formations
of
many
parts
of
the
world
,
all
geologists
believe
that
barbarian
man
existed
at
an
enormously
remote
period
;
and
we
know
that
at
the
present
day
there
is
hardly
a
tribe
so
barbarous
,
as
not
to
have
domesticated
at
least
the
dog
.
The
origin
of
most
of
our
domestic
animals
will
probably
for
ever
remain
vague
.
But
I
may
here
state
,
that
,
looking
to
the
domestic
dogs
of
the
whole
world
,
I
have
,
after
a
laborious
collection
of
all
known
facts
,
come
to
the
conclusion
that
several
wild
species
of
Canidae
have
been
tamed
,
and
that
their
blood
,
in
some
cases
mingled
together
,
flows
in
the
veins
of
our
domestic
breeds
.
In
regard
to
sheep
and
goats
I
can
form
no
decided
opinion
.
From
facts
communicated
to
me
by
Mr
.
Blyth
,
on
the
habits
,
voice
,
constitution
,
and
structure
of
the
humped
Indian
cattle
,
it
is
almost
certain
that
they
are
descended
from
a
different
aboriginal
stock
from
our
European
cattle
;
and
some
competent
judges
believe
that
these
latter
have
had
two
or
three
wild
progenitors
,
whether
or
not
these
deserve
to
be
called
species
.
This
conclusion
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
specific
distinction
between
the
humped
and
common
cattle
,
may
,
indeed
,
be
looked
upon
as
established
by
the
admirable
researches
of
Professor
Rutimeyer
.
With
respect
to
horses
,
from
reasons
which
I
cannot
here
give
,
I
am
doubtfully
inclined
to
believe
,
in
opposition
to
several
authors
,
that
all
the
races
belong
to
the
same
species
.
Having
kept
nearly
all
the
English
breeds
of
the
fowl
alive
,
having
bred
and
crossed
them
,
and
examined
their
skeletons
,
it
appears
to
me
almost
certain
that
all
are
the
descendants
of
the
wild
Indian
fowl
,
Gallus
bankiva
;
and
this
is
the
conclusion
of
Mr
.
Blyth
,
and
of
others
who
have
studied
this
bird
in
India
.
In
regard
to
ducks
and
rabbits
,
some
breeds
of
which
differ
much
from
each
other
,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
they
are
all
descended
from
the
common
wild
duck
and
rabbit
.
The
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
our
several
domestic
races
from
several
aboriginal
stocks
,
has
been
carried
to
an
absurd
extreme
by
some
authors
.
They
believe
that
every
race
which
breeds
true
,
let
the
distinctive
characters
be
ever
so
slight
,
has
had
its
wild
prototype
.
At
this
rate
there
must
have
existed
at
least
a
score
of
species
of
wild
cattle
,
as
many
sheep
,
and
several
goats
,
in
Europe
alone
,
and
several
even
within
Great
Britain
.
One
author
believes
that
there
formerly
existed
eleven
wild
species
of
sheep
peculiar
to
Great
Britain!
When
we
bear
in
mind
that
Britain
has
now
not
one
peculiar
mammal
,
and
France
but
few
distinct
from
those
of
Germany
,
and
so
with
Hungary
,
Spain
,
&c
.
,
but
that
each
of
these
kingdoms
possesses
several
peculiar
breeds
of
cattle
,
sheep
,
&c
.
,
we
must
admit
that
many
domestic
breeds
must
have
originated
in
Europe
;
for
whence
otherwise
could
they
have
been
derived
?
So
it
is
in
India
.
Even
in
the
case
of
the
breeds
of
the
domestic
dog
throughout
the
world
,
which
I
admit
are
descended
from
several
wild
species
,
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
there
has
been
an
immense
amount
of
inherited
variation
;
for
who
will
believe
that
animals
closely
resembling
the
Italian
greyhound
,
the
bloodhound
,
the
bull
dog
,
pug
dog
,
or
Blenheim
spaniel
,
&c
.
so
unlike
all
wild
Canidae
ever
existed
in
a
state
of
nature
?
It
has
often
been
loosely
said
that
all
our
races
of
dogs
have
been
produced
by
the
crossing
of
a
few
aboriginal
species
;
but
by
crossing
we
can
only
get
forms
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
their
parents
;
and
if
we
account
for
our
several
domestic
races
by
this
process
,
we
must
admit
the
former
existence
of
the
most
extreme
forms
,
as
the
Italian
greyhound
,
bloodhound
,
bulldog
,
&c
.
,
in
the
wild
state
.
Moreover
,
the
possibility
of
making
distinct
races
by
crossing
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
.
Many
cases
are
on
record
,
showing
that
a
race
may
be
modified
by
occasional
crosses
,
if
aided
by
the
careful
selection
of
the
individuals
which
present
the
desired
character
;
but
to
obtain
a
race
intermediate
between
two
quite
distinct
races
,
would
be
very
difficult
.
Sir
J
.
Sebright
expressly
experimented
with
this
object
and
failed
.
The
offspring
from
the
first
cross
between
two
pure
breeds
is
tolerably
and
sometimes
(
as
I
have
found
with
pigeons
)
quite
uniform
in
character
,
and
everything
seems
simple
enough
;
but
when
these
mongrels
are
crossed
one
with
another
for
several
generations
,
hardly
two
of
them
are
alike
and
then
the
difficulty
of
the
task
becomes
manifest
.
Breeds
of
the
Domestic
Pigeon
,
their
Differences
and
Origin
Believing
that
it
is
always
best
to
study
some
special
group
,
I
have
,
after
deliberation
,
taken
up
domestic
pigeons
.
I
have
kept
every
breed
which
I
could
purchase
or
obtain
,
and
have
been
most
kindly
favoured
with
skins
from
several
quarters
of
the
world
,
more
especially
by
the
Hon
.
W
.
Elliot
from
India
,
and
by
the
Hon
.
C
.
Murray
from
Persia
.
Many
treatises
in
different
languages
have
been
published
on
pigeons
,
and
some
of
them
are
very
important
,
as
being
of
considerable
antiquity
.
I
have
associated
with
several
eminent
fanciers
,
and
have
been
permitted
to
join
two
of
the
London
Pigeon
Clubs
.
The
diversity
of
the
breeds
is
something
astonishing
.
Compare
the
English
carrier
and
the
short
faced
tumbler
,
and
see
the
wonderful
difference
in
their
beaks
,
entailing
corresponding
differences
in
their
skulls
.
The
carrier
,
more
especially
the
male
bird
,
is
also
remarkable
from
the
wonderful
development
of
the
carunculated
skin
about
the
head
;
and
this
is
accompanied
by
greatly
elongated
eyelids
,
very
large
external
orifices
to
the
nostrils
,
and
a
wide
gape
of
mouth
.
The
short
faced
tumbler
has
a
beak
in
outline
almost
like
that
of
a
finch
;
and
the
common
tumbler
has
the
singular
inherited
habit
of
flying
at
a
great
height
in
a
compact
flock
,
and
tumbling
in
the
air
head
over
heels
.
The
runt
is
a
bird
of
great
size
,
with
long
massive
beak
and
large
feet
;
some
of
the
sub
breeds
of
runts
have
very
long
necks
,
others
very
long
wings
and
tails
,
others
singularly
short
tails
.
The
barb
is
allied
to
the
carrier
,
but
,
instead
of
a
long
beak
has
a
very
short
and
broad
one
.
The
pouter
has
a
much
elongated
body
,
wings
,
and
legs
;
and
its
enormously
developed
crop
,
which
it
glories
in
inflating
,
may
well
excite
astonishment
and
even
laughter
.
The
turbit
has
a
short
and
conical
beak
,
with
a
line
of
reversed
feathers
down
the
breast
;
and
it
has
the
habit
of
continually
expanding
slightly
,
the
upper
part
of
the
oesophagus
.
The
Jacobin
has
the
feathers
so
much
reversed
along
the
back
of
the
neck
that
they
form
a
hood
;
and
it
has
,
proportionally
to
its
size
,
elongated
wing
and
tail
feathers
.
The
trumpeter
and
laugher
,
as
their
names
express
,
utter
a
very
different
coo
from
the
other
breeds
.
The
fantail
has
thirty
or
even
forty
tailfeathers
,
instead
of
twelve
or
fourteen
the
normal
number
in
all
the
members
of
the
great
pigeon
family
:
these
feathers
are
kept
expanded
,
and
are
carried
so
erect
,
that
in
good
birds
the
head
and
tail
touch
:
the
oil
gland
is
quite
aborted
.
Several
other
less
distinct
breeds
might
be
specified
.
In
the
skeletons
of
the
several
breeds
,
the
development
of
the
bones
of
the
face
in
length
and
breadth
and
curvature
differs
enormously
.
The
shape
,
as
well
as
the
breadth
and
length
of
the
ramus
of
the
lower
jaw
,
varies
in
a
highly
remarkable
manner
.
The
caudal
and
sacral
vertebrae
vary
in
number
;
as
does
the
number
of
the
ribs
,
together
with
their
relative
breadth
and
the
presence
of
processes
.
The
size
and
shape
of
the
apertures
in
the
sternum
are
highly
variable
;
so
is
the
degree
of
divergence
and
relative
size
of
the
two
arms
of
the
furcula
.
The
proportional
width
of
the
gape
of
mouth
,
the
proportional
length
of
the
eyelids
,
of
the
orifice
of
the
nostrils
,
of
the
tongue
(
not
always
in
strict
correlation
with
the
length
of
beak
)
,
the
size
of
the
crop
and
of
the
upper
part
of
the
oesophagus
;
the
development
and
abortion
of
the
oil
gland
;
the
number
of
the
primary
wing
and
caudal
feathers
;
the
relative
length
of
the
wing
and
tail
to
each
other
and
to
the
body
;
the
relative
length
of
the
leg
and
foot
;
the
number
of
scutellae
on
the
toes
,
the
development
of
skin
between
the
toes
,
are
all
points
of
structure
which
are
variable
.
The
period
at
which
the
perfect
plumage
is
acquired
varies
,
as
does
the
state
of
the
down
with
which
the
nestling
birds
are
clothed
when
hatched
.
The
shape
and
size
of
the
eggs
vary
.
The
manner
of
flight
,
and
in
some
breeds
the
voice
and
disposition
,
differ
remarkably
.
Lastly
,
in
certain
breeds
,
the
males
and
females
have
come
to
differ
in
a
slight
degree
from
each
other
.
Altogether
at
least
a
score
of
pigeons
might
be
chosen
,
which
,
if
shown
to
an
ornithologist
,
and
he
were
told
that
they
were
wild
birds
,
would
certainly
be
ranked
by
him
as
well
defined
species
.
Moreover
,
I
do
not
believe
that
any
ornithologist
would
in
this
case
place
the
English
carrier
,
the
short
faced
tumbler
,
the
runt
,
the
barb
,
pouter
,
and
fantail
in
the
same
genus
;
more
especially
as
in
each
of
these
breeds
several
truly
inherited
sub
breeds
,
or
species
,
as
he
would
call
them
,
could
be
shown
him
.
Great
as
are
the
differences
between
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
,
I
am
fully
convinced
that
the
common
opinion
of
naturalists
is
correct
,
namely
,
that
all
are
descended
from
the
rock
pigeon
(
Columba
livia
)
,
including
under
this
term
several
geographical
races
or
sub
species
,
which
differ
from
each
other
in
the
most
trifling
respects
.
As
several
of
the
reasons
which
have
led
me
to
this
belief
are
in
some
degree
applicable
in
other
cases
,
I
will
here
briefly
give
them
.
If
the
several
breeds
are
not
varieties
,
and
have
not
proceeded
from
the
rock
pigeon
,
they
must
have
descended
from
at
least
seven
or
eight
aboriginal
stocks
;
for
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
present
domestic
breeds
by
the
crossing
of
any
lesser
number
:
how
,
for
instance
,
could
a
pouter
be
produced
by
crossing
two
breeds
unless
one
of
the
parent
stocks
possessed
the
characteristic
enormous
crop
?
The
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
all
have
been
rock
pigeons
,
that
is
,
they
did
not
breed
or
willingly
perch
on
trees
.
But
besides
C
.
livia
,
with
its
geographical
sub
species
,
only
two
or
three
other
species
of
rock
pigeons
are
known
;
and
these
have
not
any
of
the
characters
of
the
domestic
breeds
.
Hence
the
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
either
still
exist
in
the
countries
where
they
were
originally
domesticated
,
and
yet
be
unknown
to
ornithologists
;
and
this
,
considering
their
size
,
habits
,
and
remarkable
characters
,
seems
improbable
;
or
they
must
have
become
extinct
in
the
wild
state
.
But
birds
breeding
on
precipices
,
and
good
fliers
,
are
unlikely
to
be
exterminated
;
and
the
common
rock
pigeon
,
which
has
the
same
habits
with
the
domestic
breeds
,
has
not
been
exterminated
even
on
several
of
the
smaller
British
islets
,
or
on
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
.
Hence
the
supposed
extermination
of
so
many
species
having
similar
habits
with
the
rock
pigeon
seems
a
very
rash
assumption
.
Moreover
,
the
several
above
named
domesticated
breeds
have
been
transported
to
all
parts
of
the
world
,
and
,
therefore
,
some
of
them
must
have
been
carried
back
again
into
their
native
country
;
but
not
one
has
become
wild
or
feral
,
though
the
dovecot
pigeon
,
which
is
the
rock
pigeon
in
very
slightly
altered
state
,
has
become
feral
in
several
places
.
Again
,
all
recent
experience
shows
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
wild
animals
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
,
yet
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
multiple
origin
of
our
pigeons
,
it
must
be
assumed
that
at
least
seven
or
eight
species
were
so
thoroughly
domesticated
in
ancient
times
by
half
civilised
man
,
as
to
be
quite
prolific
under
confinement
.
An
argument
of
great
weight
,
and
applicable
in
several
other
cases
,
is
,
that
the
above
specified
breeds
,
though
agreeing
generally
with
the
wild
rock
pigeon
in
constitution
,
habits
,
voice
,
colouring
,
and
in
most
parts
of
their
structure
,
yet
are
certainly
highly
abnormal
in
other
parts
;
we
may
look
in
vain
through
the
whole
great
family
of
Columbidae
for
a
beak
like
that
of
the
English
carrier
,
or
that
of
the
short
faced
tumbler
,
or
barb
;
for
reversed
feathers
like
those
of
the
Jacobin
;
for
a
crop
like
that
of
the
pouter
;
for
tail
feathers
like
those
of
the
fantail
.
Hence
it
must
be
assumed
not
only
that
half
civilised
man
succeeded
in
thoroughly
domesticating
several
species
,
but
that
he
intentionally
or
by
chance
picked
out
extraordinarily
abnormal
species
;
and
further
,
that
these
very
species
have
since
all
become
extinct
or
unknown
.
So
many
strange
contingencies
are
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
.
Some
facts
in
regard
to
the
colouring
of
pigeons
well
deserve
consideration
.
The
rock
pigeon
is
of
a
slaty
blue
,
with
white
loins
;
but
the
Indian
sub
species
,
C
.
intermedia
of
Strickland
,
has
this
part
bluish
.
The
tail
has
a
terminal
dark
bar
,
with
the
outer
feathers
externally
edged
at
the
base
with
white
.
The
wings
have
two
black
bars
.
Some
semi
domestic
breeds
,
and
some
truly
wild
breeds
,
have
,
besides
the
two
black
bars
,
the
wings
chequered
with
black
.
These
several
marks
do
not
occur
together
in
any
other
species
of
the
whole
family
.
Now
,
in
every
one
of
the
domestic
breeds
,
taking
thoroughly
well
bred
birds
,
all
the
above
marks
,
even
to
the
white
edging
of
the
outer
tail
feathers
,
sometimes
concur
perfectly
developed
.
Moreover
,
when
birds
belonging
to
two
or
more
distinct
breeds
are
crossed
,
none
of
which
are
blue
or
have
any
of
the
above
specified
marks
,
the
mongrel
offspring
are
very
apt
suddenly
to
acquire
these
characters
.
To
give
one
instance
out
of
several
which
I
have
observed
:
I
crossed
some
white
fantails
,
which
breed
very
true
,
with
some
black
barbs
and
it
so
happens
that
blue
varieties
of
barbs
are
so
rare
that
I
never
heard
of
an
instance
in
England
;
and
the
mongrels
were
black
,
brown
,
and
mottled
.
I
also
crossed
a
barb
with
a
spot
,
which
is
a
white
bird
with
a
red
tail
and
red
spot
on
the
forehead
,
and
which
notoriously
breeds
very
true
;
the
mongrels
were
dusky
and
mottled
.
I
then
crossed
one
of
the
mongrel
barb
fantails
with
a
mongrel
barb
spot
,
and
they
produced
a
bird
of
as
beautiful
a
blue
colour
,
with
the
white
loins
,
double
black
wing
bar
,
and
barred
and
white
edged
tail
feathers
,
as
any
wild
rock
pigeon!
We
can
understand
these
facts
,
on
the
well
known
principle
of
reversion
to
ancestral
characters
,
if
all
the
domestic
breeds
are
descended
from
the
rock
pigeon
.
But
if
we
deny
this
,
we
must
make
one
of
the
two
following
highly
improbable
suppositions
.
Either
,
first
,
that
all
the
several
imagined
aboriginal
stocks
were
coloured
and
marked
like
the
rock
pigeon
,
although
no
other
existing
species
is
thus
coloured
and
marked
,
so
that
in
each
separate
breed
there
might
be
a
tendency
to
revert
to
the
very
same
colours
and
markings
.
Or
,
secondly
,
that
each
breed
,
even
the
purest
,
has
within
a
dozen
,
or
at
most
within
a
score
,
of
generations
,
been
crossed
by
the
rock
pigeon
:
I
say
within
dozen
or
twenty
generations
,
for
no
instance
is
known
of
crossed
descendants
reverting
to
an
ancestor
of
foreign
blood
,
removed
by
a
greater
number
of
generations
.
In
a
breed
which
has
been
crossed
only
once
,
the
tendency
to
revert
to
any
character
derived
from
such
a
cross
will
naturally
become
less
and
less
,
as
in
each
succeeding
generation
there
will
be
less
of
the
foreign
blood
;
but
when
there
has
been
no
cross
,
and
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
breed
to
revert
to
a
character
which
was
lost
during
some
former
generation
,
this
tendency
,
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
contrary
,
may
be
transmitted
undiminished
for
an
indefinite
number
of
generations
.
These
two
distinct
cases
of
reversion
are
often
confounded
together
by
those
who
have
written
on
inheritance
.
Lastly
,
the
hybrids
or
mongrels
from
between
all
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
are
perfectly
fertile
,
as
I
can
state
from
my
own
observations
,
purposely
made
,
on
the
most
distinct
breeds
.
Now
,
hardly
any
cases
have
been
ascertained
with
certainty
of
hybrids
from
two
quite
distinct
species
of
animals
being
perfectly
fertile
.
Some
authors
believe
that
long
continued
domestication
eliminates
this
strong
tendency
to
sterility
in
species
.
From
the
history
of
the
dog
,
and
of
some
other
domestic
animals
,
this
conclusion
is
probably
quite
correct
,
if
applied
to
species
closely
related
to
each
other
.
But
to
extend
it
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
species
,
aboriginally
as
distinct
as
carriers
,
tumblers
,
pouters
,
and
fantails
now
are
,
should
yield
offspring
perfectly
fertile
inter
se
,
would
be
rash
in
the
extreme
.
From
these
several
reasons
,
namely
,
the
improbability
of
man
having
formerly
made
seven
or
eight
supposed
species
of
pigeons
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
;
these
supposed
species
being
quite
unknown
in
a
wild
state
,
and
their
not
having
become
anywhere
feral
;
these
species
presenting
certain
very
abnormal
characters
,
as
compared
with
all
other
Columbidae
,
though
so
like
the
rock
pigeon
in
most
respects
;
the
occasional
reappearance
of
the
blue
colour
and
various
black
marks
in
all
the
breeds
,
both
when
kept
pure
and
when
crossed
;
and
lastly
,
the
mongrel
offspring
being
perfectly
fertile
;
from
these
several
reasons
taken
together
,
we
may
safely
conclude
that
all
our
domestic
breeds
are
descended
from
the
rock
pigeon
or
Columba
livia
with
its
geographical
sub
species
.
In
favour
of
this
view
,
I
may
add
,
firstly
,
that
the
wild
C
.
livia
has
been
found
capable
of
domestication
in
Europe
and
in
India
;
and
that
it
agrees
in
habits
and
in
a
great
number
of
points
of
structure
with
all
the
domestic
breeds
.
Secondly
,
that
,
although
an
English
carrier
or
a
short
faced
tumbler
differs
immensely
in
certain
characters
from
the
rock
pigeon
,
yet
that
,
by
comparing
the
several
sub
breeds
of
these
two
races
,
more
especially
those
brought
from
distant
countries
,
we
can
make
,
between
them
and
the
rock
pigeon
,
an
almost
perfect
series
;
so
we
can
in
some
other
cases
,
but
not
with
all
the
breeds
.
Thirdly
,
those
characters
which
are
mainly
distinctive
of
each
breed
are
in
each
eminently
variable
,
for
instance
the
wattle
and
length
of
beak
of
the
carrier
,
the
shortness
of
that
of
the
tumbler
,
and
the
number
of
tailfeathers
in
the
fantail
;
and
the
explanation
of
this
fact
will
be
obvious
when
we
treat
of
Selection
.
Fourthly
,
pigeons
have
been
watched
and
tended
with
the
utmost
care
,
and
loved
by
many
people
.
They
have
been
domesticated
for
thousands
of
years
in
several
quarters
of
the
world
;
the
earliest
known
record
of
pigeons
is
in
the
fifth
AEgyptian
dynasty
,
about
3000
B
.
C
.
,
as
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
Professor
Lepsius
;
but
Mr
.
Birch
informs
me
that
pigeons
are
given
in
a
bill
of
fare
in
the
previous
dynasty
.
In
the
time
of
the
Romans
,
as
we
hear
from
Pliny
,
immense
prices
were
given
for
pigeons
;
"
nay
,
they
are
come
to
this
pass
,
that
they
can
reckon
up
their
pedigree
and
race
.
"
Pigeons
were
much
valued
by
Akber
Khan
in
India
,
about
the
year
1600
;
never
less
than
90
,
000
pigeons
were
taken
with
the
court
.
"
The
monarchs
of
Iran
and
Turan
sent
him
some
very
rare
birds
"
;
and
continues
the
courtly
historian
,
"
His
Majesty
by
crossing
the
breeds
,
which
method
was
never
practised
before
,
has
improved
them
astonishingly
.
"
About
this
same
period
the
Dutch
were
as
eager
about
pigeons
as
were
the
old
Romans
.
The
paramount
importance
of
these
considerations
in
explaining
the
immense
amount
of
variation
which
pigeons
have
undergone
,
will
likewise
be
obvious
when
we
treat
of
Selection
.
We
shall
then
,
also
,
see
how
it
is
that
the
several
breeds
so
often
have
a
somewhat
monstrous
character
.
It
is
also
a
most
favourable
circumstance
for
the
production
of
distinct
breeds
,
that
male
and
female
pigeons
can
be
easily
mated
for
life
;
and
thus
different
breeds
can
be
kept
together
in
the
same
aviary
.
I
have
discussed
the
probable
origin
of
domestic
pigeons
at
some
,
yet
quite
insufficient
,
length
;
because
when
I
first
kept
pigeons
and
watched
the
several
kinds
,
well
knowing
how
truly
they
breed
,
I
felt
fully
as
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
since
they
had
been
domesticated
they
had
all
proceeded
from
a
common
parent
,
as
any
naturalist
could
in
coming
to
a
similar
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
many
species
of
finches
,
or
other
groups
of
birds
,
in
nature
.
One
circumstance
has
struck
me
much
;
namely
,
that
nearly
all
the
breeders
of
the
various
domestic
animals
and
the
cultivators
of
plants
,
with
whom
I
have
conversed
,
or
whose
treatises
I
have
read
,
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
several
breeds
to
which
each
has
attended
,
are
descended
from
so
many
aboriginally
distinct
species
.
Ask
,
as
I
have
asked
,
a
celebrated
raiser
of
Hereford
cattle
,
whether
his
cattle
might
not
have
descended
from
long
horns
,
or
both
from
a
common
parent
stock
,
and
he
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
.
I
have
never
met
a
pigeon
,
or
poultry
,
or
duck
,
or
rabbit
fancier
,
who
was
not
fully
convinced
that
each
main
breed
was
descended
from
a
distinct
species
.
Van
Mons
,
in
his
treatise
on
pears
and
apples
,
shows
how
utterly
he
disbelieves
that
the
several
sorts
,
for
instance
a
Ribston
pippin
or
Codlin
apple
,
could
ever
have
proceeded
from
the
seeds
of
the
same
tree
.
Innumerable
other
examples
could
be
given
.
The
explanation
,
I
think
,
is
simple
:
from
long
continued
study
they
are
strongly
impressed
with
the
differences
between
the
several
races
;
and
though
they
well
know
that
each
race
varies
slightly
,
for
they
win
their
prizes
by
selecting
such
slight
differences
,
yet
they
ignore
all
general
arguments
,
and
refuse
to
sum
up
in
their
minds
slight
differences
accumulated
during
many
successive
generations
.
May
not
those
naturalists
who
,
knowing
far
less
of
the
laws
of
inheritance
than
does
the
breeder
,
and
knowing
no
more
than
he
does
of
the
intermediate
links
in
the
long
lines
of
descent
,
yet
admit
that
many
of
our
domestic
races
are
descended
from
the
same
parents
may
they
not
learn
a
lesson
of
caution
,
when
they
deride
the
idea
of
species
in
a
state
of
nature
being
lineal
descendants
of
other
species
?
Principles
of
Selection
anciently
followed
,
and
their
Effects
Let
us
now
briefly
consider
the
steps
by
which
domestic
races
have
been
produced
,
either
from
one
or
from
several
allied
species
.
Some
effect
may
be
attributed
to
the
direct
and
definite
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
,
and
some
to
habit
;
but
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
would
account
by
such
agencies
for
the
differences
between
a
dray
and
race
horse
,
a
greyhound
and
bloodhound
,
a
carrier
and
tumbler
pigeon
.
One
of
the
most
remarkable
features
in
our
domesticated
races
is
that
we
see
in
them
adaptation
,
not
indeed
to
the
animal's
or
plant's
own
good
,
but
to
man's
use
or
fancy
.
Some
variations
useful
to
him
have
probably
arisen
suddenly
,
or
by
one
step
;
many
botanists
,
for
instance
,
believe
that
the
fuller's
teasel
,
with
its
hooks
,
which
cannot
be
rivalled
by
any
mechanical
contrivance
,
is
only
a
variety
of
the
wild
Dipsacus
;
and
this
amount
of
change
may
have
suddenly
arisen
in
a
seedling
.
So
it
has
probably
been
with
the
turnspit
dog
;
and
this
is
known
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
ancon
sheep
.
But
when
we
compare
the
dray
horse
and
race
horse
,
the
dromedary
and
camel
,
the
various
breeds
of
sheep
fitted
either
for
cultivated
land
or
mountain
pasture
,
with
the
wool
of
one
breed
good
for
one
purpose
,
and
that
of
another
breed
for
another
purpose
;
when
we
compare
the
many
breeds
of
dogs
,
each
good
for
man
in
different
ways
;
when
we
compare
the
game
cock
,
so
pertinacious
in
battle
,
with
other
breeds
so
little
quarrelsome
,
with
"
everlasting
layers
"
which
never
desire
to
sit
,
and
with
the
bantam
so
small
and
elegant
;
when
we
compare
the
host
of
agricultural
,
culinary
,
orchard
,
and
flower
garden
races
of
plants
,
most
useful
to
man
at
different
seasons
and
for
different
purposes
,
or
so
beautiful
in
his
eyes
,
we
must
,
I
think
,
look
further
than
to
mere
variability
.
We
cannot
suppose
that
all
the
breeds
were
suddenly
produced
as
perfect
and
as
useful
as
we
now
see
them
;
indeed
,
in
many
cases
,
we
know
that
this
has
not
been
their
history
.
The
key
is
man's
power
of
accumulative
selection
:
nature
gives
successive
variations
;
man
adds
them
up
in
certain
directions
useful
to
him
.
In
this
sense
he
may
be
said
to
have
made
for
himself
useful
breeds
.
The
great
power
of
this
principle
of
selection
is
not
hypothetical
.
It
is
certain
that
several
of
our
eminent
breeders
have
,
even
within
a
single
lifetime
,
modified
to
a
large
extent
their
breeds
of
cattle
and
sheep
.
In
order
fully
to
realise
what
they
have
done
,
it
is
almost
necessary
to
read
several
of
the
many
treatises
devoted
to
this
subject
,
and
to
inspect
the
animals
.
Breeders
habitually
speak
of
an
animal's
organisation
as
something
plastic
,
which
they
can
model
as
they
please
.
If
I
had
space
I
could
quote
numerous
passages
to
this
effect
from
highly
competent
authorities
.
Youatt
,
who
was
probably
better
acquainted
with
the
works
of
agriculturists
than
almost
any
other
individual
,
and
who
was
himself
a
very
good
judge
of
animals
,
speaks
of
the
principle
of
selection
as
"
that
which
enables
the
agriculturist
,
not
only
to
modify
the
character
of
his
flock
,
but
to
change
it
altogether
.
It
is
the
magician's
wand
,
by
means
of
which
he
may
summon
into
life
whatever
form
and
mould
he
pleases
.
"
Lord
Somerville
,
speaking
of
what
breeders
have
done
for
sheep
,
says
:
"
It
would
seem
as
if
they
had
chalked
out
upon
a
wall
a
form
perfect
in
itself
,
and
then
had
given
it
existence
.
"
In
Saxony
the
importance
of
the
principle
of
selection
in
regard
to
merino
sheep
is
so
fully
recognised
,
that
men
follow
it
as
a
trade
:
the
sheep
are
placed
on
a
table
and
are
studied
,
like
a
picture
by
a
connoisseur
;
this
is
done
three
times
at
intervals
of
months
,
and
the
sheep
are
each
time
marked
and
classed
,
so
that
the
very
best
may
ultimately
be
selected
for
breeding
.
What
English
breeders
have
actually
effected
is
proved
by
the
enormous
prices
given
for
animals
with
a
good
pedigree
;
and
these
have
been
exported
to
almost
every
quarter
of
the
world
.
The
improvement
is
by
no
generally
due
to
crossing
different
breeds
;
all
the
best
breeders
are
strongly
opposed
to
this
practice
,
except
sometimes
amongst
closely
allied
sub
breeds
.
And
when
a
cross
has
been
made
,
the
closest
selection
is
far
more
indispensable
even
than
in
ordinary
cases
.
If
selection
consisted
merely
in
separating
some
very
distinct
variety
,
and
breeding
from
it
,
the
principle
would
be
so
obvious
as
hardly
to
be
worth
notice
;
but
its
importance
consists
in
the
great
effect
produced
by
the
accumulation
in
one
direction
,
during
successive
generations
,
of
differences
absolutely
inappreciable
by
an
uneducated
eye
differences
which
I
for
one
have
vainly
attempted
to
appreciate
.
Not
one
man
in
a
thousand
has
accuracy
of
eye
and
judgment
sufficient
to
become
an
eminent
breeder
.
If
,
gifted
with
these
qualities
,
he
studies
his
subject
for
years
,
and
devotes
his
lifetime
to
it
with
indomitable
perseverance
,
he
will
succeed
,
and
may
make
great
improvements
;
if
he
wants
any
of
these
qualities
,
he
will
assuredly
fail
.
Few
would
readily
believe
in
the
natural
capacity
and
years
of
practice
requisite
to
become
even
a
skilful
pigeon
fancier
.
The
same
principles
are
followed
by
horticulturists
;
but
the
variations
are
here
often
more
abrupt
.
No
one
supposes
that
our
choicest
productions
have
been
produced
by
a
single
variation
from
the
aboriginal
stock
.
We
have
proofs
that
this
has
not
been
so
in
several
cases
in
which
exact
records
have
been
kept
;
thus
,
to
give
a
very
trifling
instance
,
the
steadily
increasing
size
of
the
common
gooseberry
may
be
quoted
.
We
see
an
astonishing
improvement
in
many
florists'
flowers
,
when
the
flowers
of
the
present
day
are
compared
with
drawings
made
only
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
.
When
a
race
of
plants
is
once
pretty
well
established
,
the
seed
raisers
do
not
pick
out
the
best
plants
,
but
merely
go
over
their
seed
beds
,
and
pull
up
the
"
rogues
,
"
as
they
call
the
plants
that
deviate
from
the
proper
standard
.
With
animals
this
kind
of
selection
is
,
in
fact
,
likewise
followed
;
for
hardly
any
one
is
so
careless
as
to
breed
from
his
worst
animals
.
In
regard
to
plants
,
there
is
another
means
of
observing
the
accumulated
effects
of
selection
namely
,
by
comparing
the
diversity
of
flowers
in
the
different
varieties
of
the
same
species
in
the
flower
garden
;
the
diversity
of
leaves
,
pods
,
or
tubers
,
or
whatever
part
is
valued
,
in
the
kitchen
garden
,
in
comparison
with
the
flowers
of
the
same
varieties
;
and
the
diversity
of
fruit
of
the
same
species
in
the
orchard
,
in
comparison
with
the
leaves
and
flowers
of
the
same
set
of
varieties
.
See
how
different
the
leaves
of
the
cabbage
are
,
and
how
extremely
alike
the
flowers
;
how
unlike
the
flowers
of
the
heartsease
are
,
and
how
alike
the
leaves
;
how
much
the
fruit
of
the
different
kinds
of
gooseberries
differ
in
size
,
colour
,
shape
,
and
hairiness
,
and
yet
the
flowers
present
very
slight
differences
.
It
is
not
that
the
varieties
which
differ
largely
in
some
one
point
do
not
differ
at
all
in
other
points
;
this
is
hardly
ever
,
I
speak
after
careful
observation
,
perhaps
never
,
the
case
.
The
law
of
correlated
variation
,
the
importance
of
which
should
never
be
overlooked
,
will
ensure
some
differences
;
but
,
as
a
general
rule
,
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
continued
selection
of
slight
variations
,
either
in
the
leaves
,
the
flowers
,
or
the
fruit
,
will
produce
races
differing
from
each
other
chiefly
in
these
characters
.
It
may
be
objected
that
the
principle
of
selection
has
been
reduced
to
methodical
practice
for
scarcely
more
than
three
quarters
of
a
century
;
it
has
certainly
been
more
attended
to
of
late
years
,
and
many
treatises
have
been
published
on
the
subject
;
and
the
result
has
been
,
in
a
corresponding
degree
,
rapid
and
important
.
But
it
is
very
far
from
true
that
the
principle
is
a
modern
discovery
.
I
could
give
several
references
to
works
of
high
antiquity
,
in
which
the
full
importance
of
the
principle
is
acknowledged
.
In
rude
and
barbarous
periods
of
English
history
choice
animals
were
often
imported
,
and
laws
were
passed
to
prevent
their
exportation
:
the
destruction
of
horses
under
a
certain
size
was
ordered
,
and
this
may
be
compared
to
the
"
roguing
"
of
plants
by
nurserymen
.
The
principle
of
selection
I
find
distinctly
given
in
an
ancient
Chinese
encyclopaedia
.
Explicit
rules
are
laid
down
by
some
of
the
Roman
classical
writers
.
From
passages
in
Genesis
,
it
is
clear
that
the
colour
of
domestic
animals
was
at
that
early
period
attended
to
.
Savages
now
sometimes
cross
their
dogs
with
wild
canine
animals
,
to
improve
the
breed
,
and
they
formerly
did
so
,
as
is
attested
by
passages
in
Pliny
.
The
savages
in
South
Africa
match
their
draught
cattle
by
colour
,
as
do
some
of
the
Esquimaux
their
teams
of
dogs
.
Livingstone
states
that
good
domestic
breeds
are
highly
valued
by
the
negroes
in
the
interior
of
Africa
who
have
not
associated
with
Europeans
.
Some
of
these
facts
do
not
show
actual
selection
,
but
they
show
that
the
breeding
of
domestic
animals
was
carefully
attended
to
in
ancient
times
,
and
is
now
attended
to
by
the
lowest
savages
.
It
would
,
indeed
,
have
been
a
strange
fact
,
had
attention
not
been
paid
to
breeding
,
for
the
inheritance
of
good
and
bad
qualities
is
so
obvious
.
Unconscious
Selection
At
the
present
time
,
eminent
breeders
try
by
methodical
selection
,
with
a
distinct
object
in
view
,
to
make
a
new
strain
or
sub
breed
,
superior
to
anything
of
the
kind
in
the
country
.
But
,
for
our
purpose
,
a
form
of
Selection
,
which
may
be
called
Unconscious
,
and
which
results
from
every
one
trying
to
possess
and
breed
from
the
best
individual
animals
,
is
more
important
.
Thus
,
a
man
who
intends
keeping
pointers
naturally
tries
to
get
as
good
dogs
as
he
can
,
and
afterwards
breeds
from
his
own
best
dogs
,
but
he
has
no
wish
or
expectation
of
permanently
altering
the
breed
.
Nevertheless
we
may
infer
that
this
process
,
continued
during
centuries
,
would
improve
and
modify
any
breed
,
in
the
same
way
as
Bakewell
,
Collins
,
&c
.
,
by
this
very
same
process
,
only
carried
on
more
methodically
,
did
greatly
modify
,
even
during
their
lifetimes
,
the
forms
and
qualities
of
their
cattle
.
Slow
and
insensible
changes
of
this
kind
can
never
be
recognised
unless
actual
measurements
or
careful
drawings
of
the
breeds
in
question
have
been
made
long
ago
,
which
may
serve
for
comparison
.
In
some
cases
,
however
,
unchanged
,
or
but
little
changed
individuals
of
the
same
breed
exist
in
less
civilised
districts
,
where
the
breed
has
been
less
improved
.
There
is
reason
to
believe
that
King
Charles's
spaniel
has
been
unconsciously
modified
to
a
large
extent
since
the
time
of
that
monarch
.
Some
highly
competent
authorities
are
convinced
that
the
setter
is
directly
derived
from
the
spaniel
,
and
has
probably
been
slowly
altered
from
it
.
It
is
known
that
the
English
pointer
has
been
greatly
changed
within
the
last
century
,
and
in
this
case
the
change
has
,
it
is
believed
,
been
chiefly
effected
by
crosses
with
the
foxhound
;
but
what
concerns
us
is
,
that
the
change
has
been
effected
unconsciously
and
gradually
,
and
yet
so
effectually
,
that
,
though
the
old
Spanish
pointer
certainly
came
from
Spain
,
Mr
.
Borrow
has
not
seen
,
as
I
am
informed
by
him
,
any
native
dog
in
Spain
like
our
pointer
.
By
a
similar
process
of
selection
,
and
by
careful
training
,
English
race
horses
have
come
to
surpass
in
fleetness
and
size
the
parent
Arabs
,
so
that
the
latter
,
by
the
regulations
for
the
Goodwood
Races
,
are
favoured
in
the
weights
which
they
carry
.
Lord
Spencer
and
others
have
shown
how
the
cattle
of
England
have
increased
in
weight
and
in
early
maturity
,
compared
with
the
stock
formerly
kept
in
this
country
.
By
comparing
the
accounts
given
in
various
old
treatises
of
the
former
and
present
state
of
carrier
and
tumbler
pigeons
in
Britain
,
India
,
and
Persia
,
we
can
trace
the
stages
through
which
they
have
insensibly
passed
,
and
come
to
differ
so
greatly
from
the
rock
pigeon
.
Youatt
gives
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
effects
of
a
course
of
selection
,
which
may
be
considered
as
unconscious
,
in
so
far
that
the
breeders
could
never
have
expected
,
or
even
wished
,
to
produce
the
result
which
ensued
namely
,
the
production
of
two
distinct
strains
.
The
two
flocks
of
Leicester
sheep
kept
by
Mr
.
Buckley
and
Mr
.
Burgess
,
as
Mr
.
Youatt
remarks
,
"
have
been
purely
bred
from
the
original
stock
of
Mr
.
Bakewell
for
upwards
of
fifty
years
.
There
is
not
a
suspicion
existing
in
the
mind
of
any
one
at
all
acquainted
with
the
subject
,
that
the
owner
of
either
of
them
has
deviated
in
any
one
instance
from
the
pure
blood
of
Mr
.
Bakewell's
flock
,
and
yet
the
difference
between
the
sheep
possessed
by
these
two
gentlemen
is
so
great
that
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
quite
different
varieties
.
"
If
there
exist
savages
so
barbarous
as
never
to
think
of
the
inherited
character
of
the
offspring
of
their
domestic
animals
,
yet
any
one
animal
particularly
useful
to
them
,
for
any
special
purpose
,
would
be
carefully
preserved
during
famines
and
other
accidents
,
to
which
savages
are
so
liable
,
and
such
choice
animals
would
thus
generally
leave
more
offspring
than
the
inferior
ones
;
so
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
a
kind
of
unconscious
selection
going
on
.
We
see
the
value
set
on
animals
even
by
the
barbarians
of
Tierra
del
Fuego
,
by
their
killing
and
devouring
their
old
women
,
in
times
of
dearth
,
as
of
less
value
than
their
dogs
.
In
plants
the
same
gradual
process
of
improvement
,
through
the
occasional
preservation
of
the
best
individuals
,
whether
or
not
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
ranked
at
their
first
appearance
,
as
distinct
varieties
,
and
whether
or
not
two
or
more
species
or
races
have
become
blended
together
by
crossing
,
may
plainly
be
recognised
in
the
increased
size
and
beauty
which
we
now
see
in
the
varieties
of
the
heartsease
,
rose
,
pelargonium
,
dahlia
,
and
other
plants
,
when
compared
with
the
older
varieties
or
with
their
parent
stocks
.
No
one
would
ever
expect
to
get
a
first
rate
heartsease
or
dahlia
from
the
seed
of
a
wild
plant
.
No
one
would
expect
to
raise
a
first
rate
melting
pear
from
the
seed
of
the
wild
pear
,
though
he
might
succeed
from
a
poor
seedling
growing
wild
,
if
it
had
come
from
a
garden
stock
.
The
pear
,
though
cultivated
in
classical
times
,
appears
,
from
Pliny's
description
,
to
have
been
a
fruit
of
very
inferior
quality
.
I
have
seen
great
surprise
expressed
in
horticultural
works
at
the
wonderful
skill
of
gardeners
,
in
having
produced
such
splendid
results
from
such
poor
materials
;
but
the
art
has
been
simple
,
and
,
as
far
as
the
final
result
is
concerned
,
has
been
followed
almost
unconsciously
.
It
has
consisted
in
always
cultivating
the
best
known
variety
,
sowing
its
seeds
,
and
,
when
a
slightly
better
variety
chanced
to
appear
,
selecting
it
,
and
so
onwards
.
But
the
gardeners
of
the
classical
period
who
cultivated
the
best
pears
which
they
could
procure
,
never
thought
what
splendid
fruit
we
should
eat
;
though
we
owe
our
excellent
fruit
in
some
small
degree
,
to
their
having
naturally
chosen
and
preserved
the
best
varieties
they
could
anywhere
find
.
A
large
amount
of
change
,
thus
slowly
and
unconsciously
accumulated
,
explains
,
as
I
believe
,
the
well
known
fact
,
that
in
a
number
of
cases
we
cannot
recognise
,
and
therefore
do
not
know
,
the
wild
parent
stocks
of
the
plants
which
have
been
longest
cultivated
in
our
flower
and
kitchen
gardens
.
If
it
has
taken
centuries
or
thousands
of
years
to
improve
or
modify
most
of
our
plants
up
to
their
present
standard
of
usefulness
to
man
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
neither
Australia
,
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
nor
any
other
region
inhabited
by
quite
uncivilised
man
,
has
afforded
us
a
single
plant
worth
culture
.
It
is
not
that
these
countries
,
so
rich
in
species
,
do
not
by
a
strange
chance
possess
the
aboriginal
stocks
of
any
useful
plants
,
but
that
the
native
plants
have
not
been
improved
by
continued
selection
up
to
a
standard
of
perfection
comparable
with
that
acquired
by
the
plants
in
countries
anciently
civilised
.
In
regard
to
the
domestic
animals
kept
by
uncivilised
man
,
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
they
almost
always
have
to
struggle
for
their
own
food
,
at
least
during
certain
seasons
.
And
in
two
countries
very
differently
circumstanced
,
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
having
slightly
different
constitutions
or
structure
would
often
succeed
better
in
the
one
country
than
in
the
other
;
and
thus
by
a
process
of
"
natural
selection
,
"
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
,
two
sub
breeds
might
be
formed
.
This
,
perhaps
,
partly
explains
why
the
varieties
kept
by
savages
,
as
has
been
remarked
by
some
authors
,
have
more
of
the
character
of
true
species
than
the
varieties
kept
in
civilised
countries
.
On
the
view
here
given
of
the
important
part
which
selection
by
man
has
played
,
it
becomes
at
once
obvious
,
how
it
is
that
our
domestic
races
show
adaptation
in
their
structure
or
in
their
habits
to
man's
wants
or
fancies
.
We
can
,
I
think
,
further
understand
the
frequently
abnormal
characters
of
our
domestic
races
,
and
likewise
their
differences
being
so
great
in
external
characters
,
and
relatively
so
slight
in
internal
parts
or
organs
.
Man
can
hardly
select
,
or
only
with
much
difficulty
,
any
deviation
of
structure
excepting
such
as
is
externally
visible
;
and
indeed
he
rarely
cares
for
what
is
internal
.
He
can
never
act
by
selection
,
excepting
on
variations
which
are
first
given
to
him
in
some
slight
degree
by
nature
.
No
man
would
ever
try
to
make
a
fantail
till
he
saw
a
pigeon
with
a
tail
developed
in
some
slight
degree
in
an
unusual
manner
,
or
a
pouter
till
he
saw
a
pigeon
with
a
crop
of
somewhat
unusual
size
;
and
the
more
abnormal
or
unusual
any
character
was
when
it
first
appeared
,
the
more
likely
it
would
be
to
catch
his
attention
.
But
to
use
such
an
expression
as
trying
to
make
a
fantail
,
is
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
in
most
cases
,
utterly
incorrect
.
The
man
who
first
selected
a
pigeon
with
a
slightly
larger
tail
,
never
dreamed
what
the
descendants
of
that
pigeon
would
become
through
long
continued
,
partly
unconscious
and
partly
methodical
,
selection
.
Perhaps
the
parent
bird
of
all
fantails
had
only
fourteen
tail
feathers
somewhat
expanded
,
like
the
present
Java
fantail
,
or
like
individuals
of
other
and
distinct
breeds
,
in
which
as
many
as
seventeen
tail
feathers
have
been
counted
.
Perhaps
the
first
pouter
pigeon
did
not
inflate
its
crop
much
more
than
the
turbit
now
does
the
upper
part
of
its
oesophagus
,
a
habit
which
is
disregarded
by
all
fanciers
,
as
it
is
not
one
of
the
points
of
the
breed
.
Nor
let
it
be
thought
that
some
great
deviation
of
structure
would
be
necessary
to
catch
the
fancier's
eye
:
he
perceives
extremely
small
differences
,
and
it
is
in
human
nature
to
value
any
novelty
,
however
slight
,
in
one's
own
possession
.
Nor
must
the
value
which
would
formerly
have
been
set
on
any
slight
differences
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
be
judged
of
by
the
value
which
is
now
set
on
them
,
after
several
breeds
have
fairly
been
established
.
I
is
known
that
with
pigeons
many
slight
variations
now
occasionally
appear
,
but
these
are
rejected
as
faults
or
deviations
from
the
standard
of
perfection
in
each
breed
.
The
common
goose
has
not
given
rise
to
any
marked
varieties
;
hence
the
Toulouse
and
the
common
breed
,
which
differ
only
in
colour
,
that
most
fleeting
of
characters
,
have
lately
been
exhibited
as
distinct
at
our
poultry
shows
.
These
views
appear
to
explain
what
has
sometimes
been
noticed
namely
,
that
we
know
hardly
anything
about
the
origin
or
history
of
any
of
our
domestic
breeds
.
But
,
in
fact
,
a
breed
,
like
a
dialect
of
a
language
,
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
distinct
origin
.
man
preserves
and
breeds
from
an
individual
with
some
slight
deviation
of
structure
,
or
takes
more
care
than
usual
in
matching
his
best
animals
,
and
thus
improves
them
,
and
the
improved
animals
slowly
spread
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
.
But
they
will
as
yet
hardly
have
a
distinct
name
,
and
from
being
only
slightly
valued
,
their
history
will
have
been
disregarded
.
When
further
improved
by
the
same
slow
and
gradual
process
,
they
will
spread
more
widely
,
and
will
be
recognised
as
something
distinct
and
valuable
,
and
will
then
probably
first
receive
a
provincial
name
.
In
semi
civilised
countries
,
with
little
free
communication
,
the
spreading
of
a
new
sub
breed
would
be
a
slow
process
.
As
soon
as
the
points
of
value
are
once
acknowledged
,
the
principle
,
as
I
have
called
it
,
of
unconscious
selection
will
always
tend
,
perhaps
more
at
one
period
than
at
another
,
as
the
breed
rises
or
falls
in
fashion
,
perhaps
more
in
one
district
than
in
another
,
according
to
the
state
of
civilisation
of
the
inhabitants
,
slowly
to
add
to
the
characteristic
features
of
the
breed
,
whatever
they
may
be
.
But
the
chance
will
be
infinitely
small
of
any
record
having
been
preserved
of
such
slow
,
varying
,
and
insensible
changes
.
Circumstances
favourable
to
Man's
Power
of
Selection
I
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
the
circumstances
,
favourable
,
or
the
reverse
,
to
man's
power
of
selection
.
A
high
degree
of
variability
is
obviously
favourable
,
as
freely
giving
the
materials
for
selection
to
work
on
;
not
that
mere
individual
differences
are
not
amply
sufficient
,
with
extreme
care
,
to
allow
of
the
accumulation
of
a
large
amount
of
modification
in
almost
any
desired
direction
.
But
as
variations
manifestly
useful
or
pleasing
to
man
appear
only
occasionally
,
the
chance
of
their
appearance
will
be
much
increased
by
a
large
number
of
individuals
being
kept
.
Hence
,
number
is
of
the
highest
importance
for
success
.
On
this
principle
Marshall
formerly
remarked
,
with
respect
to
the
sheep
of
parts
of
Yorkshire
,
"
as
they
generally
belong
to
poor
people
,
and
are
mostly
in
small
lots
,
they
never
can
be
improved
.
"
On
the
other
hand
,
nurserymen
,
from
keeping
large
stocks
of
the
same
plant
,
are
generally
far
more
successful
than
amateurs
in
raising
new
and
valuable
varieties
.
A
large
number
of
individuals
of
an
animal
or
plant
can
be
reared
only
where
the
conditions
for
its
propagation
are
favourable
.
When
the
individuals
are
scanty
,
all
will
be
allowed
to
breed
,
whatever
their
quality
may
be
,
and
this
will
effectually
prevent
selection
.
But
probably
the
most
important
element
is
that
the
animal
or
plant
should
be
so
highly
valued
by
man
,
that
the
closest
attention
is
paid
to
even
the
slightest
deviations
in
its
qualities
or
structure
.
Unless
such
attention
be
paid
nothing
can
be
effected
.
I
have
seen
it
gravely
remarked
,
that
it
was
most
fortunate
that
the
strawberry
began
to
vary
just
when
gardeners
began
to
attend
to
this
plant
.
No
doubt
the
strawberry
had
always
varied
since
it
was
cultivated
,
but
the
slightest
varieties
had
been
neglected
.
As
soon
,
however
,
as
gardeners
picked
out
individual
plants
with
slightly
larger
,
earlier
,
or
better
fruit
,
and
raised
seedlings
from
them
,
and
again
picked
out
the
best
seedlings
and
bred
from
them
,
then
(
with
some
aid
by
crossing
distinct
species
)
those
many
admirable
varieties
of
the
strawberry
were
raised
which
have
appeared
during
the
last
half
century
.
With
animals
,
facility
in
preventing
crosses
is
an
important
element
in
the
formation
of
new
races
,
at
least
,
in
a
country
which
is
already
stocked
with
other
races
.
In
this
respect
enclosure
of
the
land
plays
a
part
.
Wandering
savages
or
the
inhabitants
of
open
plains
rarely
possess
more
than
one
breed
of
the
same
species
.
Pigeons
can
be
mated
for
life
,
and
this
is
a
great
convenience
to
the
fancier
,
for
thus
many
races
may
be
improved
and
kept
true
,
though
mingled
in
the
same
aviary
;
and
this
circumstance
must
have
largely
favoured
the
formation
of
new
breeds
.
Pigeons
,
I
may
add
,
can
be
propagated
in
great
numbers
and
at
a
very
quick
rate
,
and
inferior
birds
may
be
freely
rejected
,
as
when
killed
they
serve
for
food
.
On
the
other
hand
,
cats
from
their
nocturnal
rambling
habits
cannot
be
easily
matched
,
and
,
although
so
much
valued
by
women
and
children
,
we
rarely
see
a
distinct
breed
long
kept
up
;
such
breeds
as
we
do
sometimes
see
are
almost
always
imported
from
some
other
country
.
Although
I
do
not
doubt
that
some
domestic
animals
vary
less
than
others
,
yet
the
rarity
or
absence
of
distinct
breeds
of
the
cat
,
the
donkey
,
peacock
,
goose
,
&c
.
,
may
be
attributed
in
main
part
to
selection
not
having
been
brought
into
play
:
in
cats
,
from
the
difficulty
in
pairing
them
;
in
donkeys
,
from
only
a
few
being
kept
by
poor
people
,
and
little
attention
paid
to
their
breeding
;
for
recently
in
certain
parts
of
Spain
and
of
the
United
States
this
animal
has
been
surprisingly
modified
and
improved
by
careful
selection
:
in
peacocks
,
from
not
being
very
easily
reared
and
a
large
stock
not
kept
:
in
geese
,
from
being
valuable
only
for
two
purposes
,
food
and
feathers
,
and
more
especially
from
no
pleasure
having
been
felt
in
the
display
of
distinct
breeds
;
but
the
goose
,
under
the
conditions
to
which
it
is
exposed
when
domesticated
seems
to
have
a
singularly
inflexible
organisation
,
though
it
has
varied
to
a
slight
extent
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
described
.
Some
authors
have
maintained
that
the
amount
of
variation
in
our
domestic
productions
is
soon
reached
,
and
can
never
afterwards
be
exceeded
.
It
would
be
somewhat
rash
to
assert
that
the
limit
has
been
attained
in
any
one
case
;
for
almost
all
our
animals
and
plants
have
been
greatly
improved
in
many
ways
within
a
recent
period
;
and
this
implies
variation
.
It
would
be
equally
rash
to
assert
that
characters
now
increased
to
their
utmost
limit
,
could
not
,
after
remaining
fixed
for
many
centuries
,
again
vary
under
new
conditions
of
life
.
No
doubt
,
as
Mr
.
Wallace
has
remarked
with
much
truth
,
a
limit
will
be
at
last
reached
.
For
instance
,
there
must
be
a
limit
to
the
fleetness
of
any
terrestrial
animal
,
as
this
will
be
determined
by
the
friction
to
be
overcome
,
the
weight
of
body
to
be
carried
,
and
the
power
of
contraction
in
the
muscular
fibres
.
But
what
concerns
us
is
that
the
domestic
varieties
of
the
same
species
differ
from
each
other
in
almost
every
character
,
which
man
has
attended
to
and
selected
,
more
than
do
the
distinct
species
of
the
same
genera
.
Isidore
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire
has
proved
this
in
regard
to
size
,
and
so
it
is
with
colour
and
probably
with
the
length
of
hair
.
With
respect
to
fleetness
,
which
depends
on
many
bodily
characters
,
Eclipse
was
far
fleeter
,
and
a
dray
horse
is
incomparably
stronger
than
any
two
natural
species
belonging
to
the
same
genus
.
So
with
plants
,
the
seeds
of
the
different
varieties
of
the
bean
or
maize
probably
differ
more
in
size
,
than
do
the
seeds
of
the
distinct
species
in
any
one
genus
in
the
same
two
families
.
The
same
remark
holds
good
in
regard
to
the
fruit
of
the
several
varieties
of
the
plum
,
and
still
more
strongly
with
the
melon
,
as
well
as
in
many
other
analogous
cases
.
To
sum
up
on
the
origin
of
our
domestic
races
of
animals
and
plants
.
Changed
conditions
of
life
are
of
the
highest
importance
in
causing
variability
,
both
by
acting
directly
on
the
organisation
,
and
indirectly
by
affecting
the
reproductive
system
.
It
is
not
probable
that
variability
is
an
inherent
and
necessary
contingent
,
under
all
circumstances
.
The
greater
or
less
force
of
inheritance
and
reversion
,
determine
whether
variations
shall
endure
.
Variability
is
governed
by
many
unknown
laws
,
of
which
correlated
growth
is
probably
the
most
important
.
Something
,
but
how
much
we
do
not
know
,
may
be
attributed
to
the
definite
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
.
Some
,
perhaps
a
great
,
effect
may
be
attributed
to
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
.
The
final
result
is
thus
rendered
infinitely
complex
.
In
some
cases
the
intercrossing
of
aboriginally
distinct
species
appears
to
have
played
an
important
part
in
the
origin
of
our
breeds
.
When
several
breeds
have
once
been
formed
in
any
country
,
their
occasional
intercrossing
,
with
the
aid
of
selection
,
has
,
no
doubt
,
largely
aided
in
the
formation
of
new
sub
breeds
;
but
the
importance
of
crossing
has
been
much
exaggerated
,
both
in
regard
to
animals
and
to
those
plants
which
are
propagated
by
seed
.
With
plants
which
are
temporarily
propagated
by
cuttings
,
buds
,
&c
.
,
the
importance
of
crossing
is
immense
;
for
the
cultivator
may
here
disregard
the
extreme
variability
both
of
hybrids
and
of
mongrels
,
and
the
sterility
of
hybrids
;
but
plants
not
propagated
by
seed
are
of
little
importance
to
us
,
for
their
endurance
is
only
temporary
.
Over
all
these
causes
of
Change
,
the
accumulative
action
of
Selection
,
whether
applied
methodically
and
quickly
,
or
unconsciously
and
slowly
but
more
efficiently
,
seems
to
have
been
the
predominant
Power
.
CHAPTER
II
VARIATION
UNDER
NATURE
BEFORE
applying
the
principles
arrived
at
in
the
last
chapter
to
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
,
we
must
briefly
discuss
whether
these
latter
are
subject
to
any
variation
.
To
treat
this
subject
properly
,
a
long
catalogue
of
dry
facts
ought
to
be
given
;
but
these
shall
reserve
for
a
future
work
.
Nor
shall
I
here
discuss
the
various
definitions
which
have
been
given
of
the
term
species
.
No
one
definition
has
satisfied
all
naturalists
;
yet
every
naturalist
knows
vaguely
what
he
means
when
he
speaks
of
a
species
.
Generally
the
term
includes
the
unknown
element
of
a
distant
act
of
creation
.
The
term
"
variety
"
is
almost
equally
difficult
to
define
;
but
here
community
of
descent
is
almost
universally
implied
,
though
it
can
rarely
be
proved
.
We
have
also
what
are
called
monstrosities
;
but
they
graduate
into
varieties
.
By
a
monstrosity
I
presume
is
meant
some
considerable
deviation
of
structure
,
generally
injurious
,
or
not
useful
to
the
species
.
Some
authors
use
the
term
"
variation
"
in
a
technical
sense
,
as
implying
a
modification
directly
due
to
the
physical
conditions
of
life
;
and
"
variations
"
in
this
sense
are
supposed
not
to
be
inherited
;
but
who
can
say
that
the
dwarfed
condition
of
shells
in
the
brackish
waters
of
the
Baltic
,
or
dwarfed
plants
on
Alpine
summits
,
or
the
thicker
fur
of
an
animal
from
far
northwards
,
would
not
in
some
cases
be
inherited
for
at
least
a
few
generations
?
And
in
this
case
I
presume
that
the
form
would
be
called
a
variety
.
It
may
be
doubted
whether
sudden
and
considerable
deviations
of
structure
such
as
we
occasionally
see
in
our
domestic
productions
,
more
especially
with
plants
,
are
ever
permanently
propagated
in
a
state
of
nature
.
Almost
every
part
of
every
organic
being
is
so
beautifully
related
to
its
complex
conditions
of
life
that
it
seems
as
improbable
that
any
part
should
have
been
suddenly
produced
perfect
,
as
that
a
complex
machine
should
have
been
invented
by
man
in
a
perfect
state
.
Under
domestication
monstrosities
sometimes
occur
which
resemble
normal
structures
in
widely
different
animals
.
Thus
pigs
have
occasionally
been
born
with
a
sort
of
proboscis
,
and
if
any
wild
species
of
the
same
genus
had
naturally
possessed
a
proboscis
,
it
might
have
been
argued
that
this
had
appeared
as
a
monstrosity
;
but
I
have
as
yet
failed
to
find
,
after
diligent
search
,
cases
of
monstrosities
resembling
normal
structures
in
nearly
allied
forms
,
and
these
alone
bear
on
the
question
.
If
monstrous
forms
of
this
kind
ever
do
appear
in
a
state
of
nature
and
are
capable
of
reproduction
(
which
is
not
always
the
case
)
,
as
they
occur
rarely
and
singularly
,
their
preservation
would
depend
on
unusually
favourable
circumstances
.
They
would
,
also
,
during
the
first
and
succeeding
generations
cross
with
the
ordinary
form
,
and
thus
their
abnormal
character
would
almost
inevitably
be
lost
.
But
I
shall
have
to
return
in
a
future
chapter
to
the
preservation
and
perpetuation
of
single
or
occasional
variations
.
Individual
Differences
The
many
slight
differences
which
appear
in
the
offspring
from
the
same
parents
,
or
which
it
may
be
presumed
have
thus
arisen
,
from
being
observed
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
inhabiting
the
same
confined
locality
,
may
be
called
individual
differences
.
No
one
supposes
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
cast
in
the
same
actual
mould
.
These
individual
differences
are
of
the
highest
importance
for
us
,
for
they
are
often
inherited
,
as
must
be
familiar
to
every
one
;
and
they
thus
afford
materials
for
natural
selection
to
act
on
and
accumulate
,
in
the
same
manner
as
man
accumulates
in
any
given
direction
individual
differences
in
his
domesticated
productions
.
These
individual
differences
generally
affect
what
naturalists
consider
unimportant
parts
;
but
I
could
show
by
a
long
catalogue
of
facts
,
that
parts
which
must
be
called
important
,
whether
viewed
under
a
physiological
or
classificatory
point
of
view
,
sometimes
vary
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
.
I
am
convinced
that
the
most
experienced
naturalist
would
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
the
cases
of
variability
,
even
in
important
parts
of
structure
,
which
he
could
collect
on
good
authority
,
as
I
have
collected
,
during
a
course
of
years
.
It
should
be
remembered
that
systematists
are
far
from
being
pleased
at
finding
variability
in
important
characters
,
and
that
there
are
not
many
men
who
will
laboriously
examine
internal
and
important
organs
,
and
compare
them
in
many
specimens
of
the
same
species
.
It
would
never
have
been
expected
that
the
branching
of
the
main
nerves
close
to
the
great
central
ganglion
of
an
insect
would
have
been
variable
in
the
same
species
;
it
might
have
been
thought
that
changes
of
this
nature
could
have
been
effected
only
by
slow
degrees
;
yet
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
has
shown
a
degree
of
variability
in
these
main
nerves
in
Coccus
,
which
may
almost
be
compared
to
the
irregular
branching
of
a
stem
of
a
tree
.
This
philosophical
naturalist
,
I
may
add
,
has
also
shown
that
the
muscles
in
the
larvae
of
certain
insects
are
far
from
uniform
.
Authors
sometimes
argue
in
a
circle
when
they
state
that
important
organs
never
vary
;
for
these
same
authors
practically
rank
those
parts
as
important
(
as
some
few
naturalists
have
honestly
confessed
)
which
do
not
vary
;
and
,
under
this
point
of
view
,
no
instance
will
ever
be
found
of
an
important
part
varying
;
but
under
any
other
point
of
view
many
instances
assuredly
can
be
given
.
There
is
one
point
connected
with
individual
differences
,
which
is
extremely
perplexing
:
I
refer
to
those
genera
which
have
been
called
"
protean
"
or
"
Polymorphic
,
"
in
which
the
species
present
an
inordinate
amount
of
variation
.
With
respect
to
many
of
these
forms
,
hardly
two
naturalists
agree
whether
to
rank
them
as
species
or
as
varieties
.
We
may
instance
Rubus
,
Rosa
,
and
Hieracium
amongst
plants
,
several
genera
of
and
of
brachiopod
shells
.
In
most
polymorphic
genera
some
of
the
species
have
fixed
and
definite
characters
.
Genera
which
are
polymorphic
in
one
country
seem
to
be
,
with
a
few
exceptions
,
polymorphic
in
other
countries
,
and
likewise
,
judging
from
brachiopod
shells
,
at
former
periods
of
time
.
These
facts
are
very
perplexing
,
for
they
seem
to
show
that
this
kind
of
variability
is
independent
of
the
conditions
of
life
.
I
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
we
see
,
at
least
in
some
of
these
polymorphic
genera
,
variations
which
are
of
no
service
or
disservice
to
the
species
,
and
which
consequently
have
not
been
seized
on
and
rendered
definite
by
natural
selection
,
as
hereafter
to
be
explained
.
Individuals
of
the
same
species
often
present
,
as
is
known
to
every
one
,
great
differences
of
structure
,
independently
of
variation
,
as
in
the
two
sexes
of
various
animals
,
in
the
two
or
three
castes
of
sterile
females
or
workers
amongst
insects
,
and
in
the
immature
and
larval
states
of
many
of
the
lower
animals
.
There
are
,
also
,
cases
of
dimorphism
and
trimorphism
,
both
with
animals
and
plants
.
Thus
,
Mr
.
Wallace
,
who
has
lately
called
attention
to
the
subject
,
has
shown
that
the
females
of
certain
species
of
butterflies
,
in
the
Malayan
archipelago
,
regularly
appear
under
two
or
even
three
conspicuously
distinct
forms
,
not
connected
by
intermediate
varieties
.
Fritz
Muller
has
described
analogous
but
more
extraordinary
cases
with
the
males
of
certain
Brazilian
crustaceans
:
thus
,
the
male
of
the
Tanais
regularly
occurs
under
two
distinct
forms
;
one
of
these
has
strong
and
differently
shaped
pincers
,
and
the
other
has
antennae
much
more
abundantly
furnished
with
smelling
hairs
.
Although
in
most
of
these
cases
,
the
two
or
three
forms
,
both
with
animals
and
plants
are
not
now
connected
by
intermediate
gradations
,
it
is
probable
that
they
were
once
thus
connected
.
Mr
.
Wallace
,
for
instance
,
describes
a
certain
butterfly
which
presents
in
the
same
island
a
great
range
of
varieties
connected
by
intermediate
links
,
and
the
extreme
links
of
the
chain
closely
resemble
the
two
forms
of
an
allied
dimorphic
species
inhabiting
another
part
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
.
Thus
also
with
ants
,
the
several
worker
castes
are
generally
quite
distinct
;
but
in
some
cases
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
the
castes
are
connected
together
by
finely
graduated
varieties
.
So
it
is
,
as
I
myself
observed
,
with
some
dimorphic
plants
.
It
certainly
at
first
appears
a
highly
remarkable
fact
that
the
same
female
butterfly
should
have
the
power
of
producing
at
the
same
time
three
distinct
female
forms
and
a
male
;
and
that
an
hermaphrodite
plant
should
produce
from
the
same
seed
capsule
three
distinct
hermaphrodite
forms
,
bearing
three
different
kinds
of
females
and
three
or
even
six
different
kinds
of
males
.
Nevertheless
these
cases
are
only
exaggerations
of
the
common
fact
that
the
female
produces
offspring
of
two
sexes
which
sometimes
differ
from
each
other
in
a
wonderful
manner
.
Doubtful
Species
The
forms
which
possess
in
some
considerable
degree
the
character
of
species
,
but
which
are
go
closely
similar
to
other
forms
,
or
are
so
closely
linked
to
them
by
intermediate
gradations
,
that
naturalists
do
not
like
to
rank
them
as
distinct
species
,
are
in
several
respects
the
most
important
for
us
.
We
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
many
of
these
doubtful
and
closely
allied
forms
have
permanently
retained
their
characters
for
a
long
time
;
for
as
long
,
as
far
as
we
know
,
as
have
good
and
true
species
.
Practically
,
when
a
naturalist
can
unite
by
means
of
intermediate
links
any
two
forms
,
he
treats
the
one
as
a
variety
of
the
other
;
ranking
the
most
common
,
but
sometimes
the
one
first
described
,
as
the
species
,
and
the
other
as
the
variety
.
But
cases
of
great
difficulty
,
which
I
will
not
here
enumerate
,
sometimes
arise
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
rank
one
form
as
a
variety
of
another
,
even
when
they
are
closely
connected
by
intermediate
links
;
nor
will
the
commonly
assumed
hybrid
nature
of
the
intermediate
forms
always
remove
the
difficulty
.
In
very
many
cases
,
however
,
one
form
is
ranked
as
a
variety
of
another
,
not
because
the
intermediate
links
have
actually
been
found
,
but
because
analogy
leads
the
observer
to
suppose
either
that
they
do
now
somewhere
exist
,
or
may
formerly
have
existed
;
and
here
a
wide
door
for
the
entry
of
doubt
and
conjecture
is
opened
.
Hence
,
in
determining
whether
a
form
should
be
ranked
as
a
species
or
a
variety
,
the
opinion
of
naturalists
having
sound
judgment
and
wide
experience
seems
the
only
guide
to
follow
.
We
must
,
however
,
in
many
cases
,
decide
by
a
majority
of
naturalists
,
for
few
well
marked
and
well
known
varieties
can
be
named
which
have
not
been
ranked
as
species
by
at
least
some
competent
judges
.
That
varieties
of
this
doubtful
nature
are
far
from
uncommon
cannot
be
disputed
.
Compare
the
several
floras
of
Great
Britain
,
of
France
,
or
of
the
United
States
,
drawn
up
by
different
botanists
,
and
see
what
a
surprising
number
of
forms
have
been
ranked
by
one
botanist
as
good
species
,
and
by
another
as
mere
varieties
.
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
,
to
whom
I
lie
under
deep
obligation
for
assistance
of
all
kinds
,
has
marked
for
me
182
British
plants
,
which
are
generally
considered
as
varieties
,
but
which
have
all
been
ranked
by
botanists
as
species
;
and
,
in
making
this
list
,
he
has
omitted
many
trifling
varieties
,
which
nevertheless
have
been
ranked
by
some
botanists
as
species
,
and
he
has
entirely
omitted
several
highly
polymorphic
genera
.
Under
genera
,
including
the
most
polymorphic
forms
,
Mr
.
Babington
gives
251
species
,
whereas
Mr
.
Bentham
gives
only
112
,
a
difference
of
139
doubtful
forms!
Amongst
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
,
and
which
are
highly
locomotive
,
doubtful
forms
,
ranked
by
one
zoologist
as
a
species
and
by
another
as
a
variety
,
can
rarely
be
found
within
the
same
country
,
but
are
common
in
separated
areas
.
How
many
of
the
birds
and
insects
in
North
America
and
Europe
,
which
differ
very
slightly
from
each
other
,
have
been
ranked
by
one
eminent
naturalist
as
undoubted
species
,
and
by
another
as
varieties
,
or
,
as
they
are
often
called
,
geographical
races!
Mr
.
Wallace
,
in
several
valuable
papers
on
the
various
animals
,
especially
on
the
Lepidoptera
,
inhabiting
the
islands
of
the
great
Malayan
archipelago
,
shows
that
they
may
be
classed
under
four
heads
,
namely
,
as
variable
forms
,
as
local
forms
,
as
geographical
races
or
sub
species
,
and
as
true
representative
species
.
The
first
or
variable
forms
vary
much
within
the
limits
of
the
same
island
.
The
local
forms
are
moderately
constant
and
distinct
in
each
separate
island
;
but
when
all
from
the
several
islands
are
compared
together
,
the
differences
are
seen
to
be
so
slight
and
graduated
,
that
it
is
impossible
to
define
or
describe
them
,
though
at
the
same
time
the
extreme
forms
are
sufficiently
distinct
.
The
geographical
races
or
sub
species
are
local
forms
completely
fixed
and
isolated
;
but
as
they
do
not
differ
from
each
other
by
strongly
marked
and
important
characters
,
"
there
is
no
possible
test
but
individual
opinion
to
determine
which
of
them
shall
be
considered
as
species
and
which
as
varieties
.
"
Lastly
,
representative
species
fill
the
same
place
in
the
natural
economy
of
each
island
as
do
the
local
forms
and
sub
species
;
but
as
they
are
distinguished
from
each
other
by
a
greater
amount
of
difference
than
that
between
the
local
forms
and
sub
species
,
they
are
almost
universally
ranked
by
naturalists
as
true
species
.
Nevertheless
,
no
certain
criterion
can
possibly
be
given
by
which
variable
forms
,
local
forms
,
sub
species
,
and
representative
species
can
be
recognised
.
Many
years
ago
,
when
comparing
,
and
seeing
others
compare
,
the
birds
from
the
closely
neighbouring
islands
of
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
one
with
another
,
and
with
those
from
the
American
mainland
,
I
was
much
struck
how
entirely
vague
and
arbitrary
is
the
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
.
On
the
islets
of
the
little
Madeira
group
there
are
many
insects
which
are
characterised
as
varieties
in
Mr
.
Wollaston's
admirable
work
,
but
which
would
certainly
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
by
many
entomologists
.
Even
Ireland
has
a
few
animals
,
now
generally
regarded
as
varieties
,
but
which
have
been
ranked
as
species
by
some
zoologists
.
Several
experienced
ornithologists
consider
our
British
red
grouse
as
only
a
strongly
marked
race
of
a
Norwegian
species
,
whereas
the
greater
number
rank
it
as
an
undoubted
species
peculiar
to
Great
Britain
.
A
wide
distance
between
the
homes
of
two
doubtful
forms
leads
many
naturalists
to
rank
them
as
distinct
species
;
but
what
distance
,
it
has
been
well
asked
,
will
suffice
;
if
that
between
America
and
Europe
is
ample
,
will
that
between
Europe
and
the
Azores
,
or
Madeira
,
or
the
Canaries
,
or
between
the
several
islets
of
these
small
archipelagos
,
be
sufficient
?
Mr
.
B
.
D
.
Walsh
,
a
distinguished
entomologist
of
the
United
States
,
has
described
what
he
calls
phytophagic
varieties
and
phytophagic
species
.
Most
vegetable
feeding
insects
live
on
one
kind
of
plant
or
on
one
group
of
plants
;
some
feed
indiscriminately
on
many
kinds
,
but
do
not
in
consequence
vary
.
In
several
cases
,
however
,
insects
found
living
on
different
plants
,
have
been
observed
by
Mr
.
Walsh
to
present
in
their
larval
or
mature
state
,
or
in
both
states
,
slight
,
though
constant
differences
in
colour
,
size
,
or
in
the
nature
of
their
secretions
.
In
some
instances
the
males
alone
,
in
other
instances
both
males
and
females
,
have
been
observed
thus
to
differ
in
a
slight
degree
.
When
the
differences
are
rather
more
strongly
marked
,
and
when
both
sexes
and
all
ages
are
affected
,
the
forms
are
ranked
by
all
entomologists
as
good
species
.
But
no
observer
can
determine
for
another
,
even
if
he
can
do
so
for
himself
,
which
of
these
phytophagic
forms
ought
to
be
called
species
and
which
varieties
.
Mr
.
Walsh
ranks
the
forms
which
it
may
be
supposed
would
freely
intercross
,
as
varieties
;
and
those
which
appear
to
have
lost
this
power
,
as
species
.
As
the
differences
depend
on
the
insects
having
long
fed
on
distinct
plants
,
it
cannot
be
expected
that
intermediate
links
connecting
the
several
forms
should
now
be
found
.
The
naturalist
thus
loses
his
best
guide
in
determining
whether
to
rank
doubtful
forms
as
varieties
or
species
.
This
likewise
necessarily
occurs
with
closely
allied
organisms
,
which
inhabit
distinct
continents
or
islands
.
When
,
on
the
other
hand
,
an
animal
or
plant
ranges
over
the
same
continent
,
or
inhabits
many
islands
in
the
same
archipelago
,
and
presents
different
forms
in
the
different
areas
,
there
is
always
a
good
chance
that
intermediate
forms
will
be
discovered
which
will
link
together
the
extreme
states
,
and
these
are
then
degraded
to
the
rank
of
varieties
.
Some
few
naturalists
maintain
that
animals
never
present
varieties
;
but
then
these
same
naturalists
rank
the
slightest
difference
as
of
specific
value
;
and
when
the
same
identical
form
is
met
with
in
two
distant
countries
,
or
in
two
geological
formations
,
they
believe
that
two
distinct
species
are
hidden
under
the
same
dress
.
The
term
species
thus
comes
to
be
a
mere
useless
abstraction
,
implying
and
assuming
a
separate
act
of
creation
.
It
is
certain
that
many
forms
,
considered
by
highly
competent
judges
to
be
varieties
,
resemble
species
so
completely
in
character
,
that
they
have
been
thus
ranked
by
other
highly
competent
judges
.
But
to
discuss
whether
they
ought
to
be
called
species
or
varieties
,
before
any
definition
of
these
terms
has
been
generally
accepted
,
is
vainly
to
beat
the
air
.
Many
of
the
cases
of
strongly
marked
varieties
or
doubtful
species
well
deserve
consideration
;
for
several
interesting
lines
of
argument
,
from
geographical
distribution
,
analogical
variation
,
hybridism
,
&c
.
,
have
been
brought
to
bear
in
the
attempt
to
determine
their
rank
;
but
space
does
not
here
permit
me
to
discuss
them
.
Close
investigation
,
in
many
cases
,
will
no
doubt
bring
naturalists
to
agree
how
to
rank
doubtful
forms
.
Yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
is
in
the
best
known
countries
that
we
find
the
greatest
number
of
them
.
I
have
been
struck
with
the
fact
,
that
if
any
animal
or
plant
in
a
state
of
nature
be
highly
useful
to
man
,
or
from
any
cause
closely
attracts
his
attention
,
varieties
of
it
will
almost
universally
be
found
recorded
.
These
varieties
,
moreover
,
will
often
be
ranked
by
some
authors
as
species
.
Look
at
the
common
oak
,
how
closely
it
has
been
studied
;
yet
a
German
author
makes
more
than
a
dozen
species
out
of
forms
,
which
are
almost
universally
considered
by
other
botanists
to
be
varieties
;
and
in
this
country
the
highest
botanical
authorities
and
practical
men
can
be
quoted
to
show
that
the
sessile
and
pedunculated
oaks
are
either
good
and
distinct
species
or
mere
varieties
.
I
may
here
allude
to
a
remarkable
memoir
lately
published
by
A
.
de
Candolle
,
on
the
oaks
of
the
whole
world
.
No
one
ever
had
more
ample
materials
for
the
discrimination
of
the
species
,
or
could
have
worked
on
them
with
more
zeal
and
sagacity
.
He
first
gives
in
detail
all
the
many
points
of
structure
which
vary
in
the
several
species
,
and
estimates
numerically
the
relative
frequency
of
the
variations
.
He
specifies
above
a
dozen
characters
which
may
be
found
varying
even
on
the
same
branch
,
sometimes
according
to
age
or
development
,
sometimes
without
any
assignable
reason
.
Such
characters
are
not
of
course
of
specific
value
,
but
they
are
,
as
Asa
Gray
has
remarked
in
commenting
on
this
memoir
,
such
as
generally
enter
into
specific
definitions
.
De
Candolle
then
goes
on
to
say
that
he
gives
the
rank
of
species
to
the
forms
that
differ
by
characters
never
varying
on
the
same
tree
,
and
never
found
connected
by
intermediate
states
.
After
this
discussion
,
the
result
of
so
much
labour
,
he
emphatically
remarks
:
"
They
are
mistaken
,
who
repeat
that
the
greater
part
of
our
species
are
clearly
limited
,
and
that
the
doubtful
species
are
in
a
feeble
minority
.
This
seemed
to
be
true
,
so
long
as
a
genus
was
imperfectly
known
,
and
its
species
were
founded
upon
a
few
specimens
,
that
is
to
say
,
were
provisional
.
Just
as
we
come
to
know
them
better
,
intermediate
forms
flow
in
,
and
doubts
as
to
specific
limits
augment
.
"
He
also
adds
that
it
is
the
best
known
species
which
present
the
greater
number
of
spontaneous
varieties
and
sub
varieties
.
Thus
Quercus
robur
has
twenty
eight
varieties
,
all
of
which
,
excepting
six
,
are
clustered
round
three
sub
species
,
namely
,
Q
.
pedunculata
,
sessiliflora
,
and
pubescens
.
The
forms
which
connect
these
three
sub
species
are
comparatively
rare
;
and
,
as
Asa
Gray
again
remarks
,
if
these
connecting
forms
which
are
now
rare
,
were
to
become
wholly
extinct
,
the
three
sub
species
would
hold
exactly
the
same
relation
to
each
other
,
as
do
the
four
or
five
provisionally
admitted
species
which
closely
surround
the
typical
Quercus
robur
.
Finally
,
De
Candolle
admits
that
out
of
the
300
species
,
which
will
be
enumerated
in
his
Prodromus
as
belonging
to
the
oak
family
,
at
least
two
thirds
are
provisional
species
,
that
is
,
are
not
known
strictly
to
fulfil
the
definition
above
given
of
a
true
species
.
It
should
be
added
that
De
Candolle
no
longer
believes
that
species
are
immutable
creations
,
but
concludes
that
the
derivative
theory
is
the
most
natural
one
,
"
and
the
most
accordant
with
the
known
facts
in
palaeontology
,
geographical
botany
and
zoology
,
of
anatomical
structure
and
classification
.
"
When
a
young
naturalist
commences
the
study
of
a
group
of
organisms
quite
unknown
to
him
,
he
is
at
first
much
perplexed
in
determining
what
differences
to
consider
as
specific
,
and
what
as
varietal
;
for
he
knows
nothing
of
the
amount
and
kind
of
variation
to
which
the
group
is
subject
;
and
this
shows
,
at
least
,
how
very
generally
there
is
some
variation
.
But
if
he
confine
his
attention
to
one
class
within
one
country
,
he
will
soon
make
up
his
mind
how
to
rank
most
of
the
doubtful
forms
.
His
general
tendency
will
be
to
make
many
species
,
for
he
will
become
impressed
,
just
like
the
pigeon
or
poultry
fancier
before
alluded
to
,
with
the
amount
of
difference
in
the
forms
which
he
is
continually
studying
;
and
he
has
little
general
knowledge
of
analogical
variation
in
other
groups
and
in
other
countries
,
by
which
to
correct
his
first
impressions
.
As
he
extends
the
range
of
his
observations
,
he
will
meet
with
more
cases
of
difficulty
;
for
he
will
encounter
a
greater
number
of
closely
allied
forms
.
But
if
his
observations
be
widely
extended
,
he
will
in
the
end
generally
be
able
to
make
up
his
own
mind
:
but
he
will
succeed
in
this
at
the
expense
of
admitting
much
variation
,
and
the
truth
of
this
admission
will
often
be
disputed
by
other
naturalists
.
When
he
comes
to
study
allied
forms
brought
from
countries
not
now
continuous
,
in
which
case
he
cannot
hope
to
find
intermediate
links
,
he
will
be
compelled
to
trust
almost
entirely
to
analogy
,
and
his
difficulties
will
rise
to
a
climax
.
Certainly
no
clear
line
of
demarcation
has
as
yet
been
drawn
between
species
and
sub
species
that
is
,
the
forms
which
in
the
opinion
of
some
naturalists
come
very
near
to
,
but
do
not
quite
arrive
at
,
the
rank
of
species
:
or
,
again
,
between
sub
species
and
well
marked
varieties
,
or
between
lesser
varieties
and
individual
differences
.
These
differences
blend
into
each
other
by
an
insensible
series
;
and
a
series
impresses
the
mind
with
the
idea
of
an
actual
passage
.
Hence
I
look
at
individual
differences
,
though
of
small
interest
to
the
systematist
,
as
of
the
highest
importance
for
us
,
as
being
the
first
steps
towards
such
slight
varieties
as
are
barely
thought
worth
recording
in
works
on
natural
history
.
And
I
look
at
varieties
which
are
in
any
degree
more
distinct
and
permanent
,
as
steps
towards
more
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
;
and
at
the
latter
,
as
leading
to
sub
species
,
and
then
to
species
.
The
passage
from
one
stage
of
difference
to
another
may
,
in
many
cases
,
be
the
simple
result
of
the
nature
of
the
organism
and
of
the
different
physical
conditions
to
which
it
has
long
been
exposed
;
but
with
respect
to
the
more
important
and
adaptive
characters
,
the
passage
from
one
stage
of
difference
to
another
may
be
safely
attributed
to
the
cumulative
action
of
natural
selection
,
hereafter
to
be
explained
,
and
to
the
effects
of
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
.
A
well
marked
variety
may
therefore
be
called
an
incipient
species
;
but
whether
this
belief
is
justifiable
must
be
judged
by
the
weight
of
the
various
facts
and
considerations
to
be
given
throughout
this
work
.
It
need
not
be
supposed
that
all
varieties
or
incipient
species
attain
the
rank
of
species
.
They
may
become
extinct
,
or
they
may
endure
as
varieties
for
very
long
periods
,
as
has
been
shown
to
be
the
case
by
Mr
.
Wollaston
with
the
varieties
of
certain
fossil
land
shell
in
Madeira
,
and
with
plants
by
Gaston
de
Saporta
.
If
a
variety
were
to
flourish
so
as
to
exceed
in
numbers
the
parent
species
,
it
would
then
rank
as
the
species
,
and
the
species
as
the
variety
;
or
it
might
come
to
supplant
and
exterminate
the
parent
species
;
or
both
might
co
exist
,
and
both
rank
as
independent
species
.
But
we
shall
hereafter
return
to
this
subject
.
From
these
remarks
it
will
be
seen
that
I
look
at
the
term
species
as
one
arbitrarily
given
,
for
the
sake
of
convenience
,
to
a
set
of
individuals
closely
resembling
each
other
,
and
that
it
does
not
essentially
differ
from
the
term
variety
,
which
is
given
to
less
distinct
and
more
fluctuating
forms
.
The
term
variety
,
again
,
in
comparison
with
mere
individual
differences
,
is
also
applied
arbitrarily
,
for
convenience'
sake
.
Wide
ranging
,
much
diffused
,
and
common
Species
vary
most
Guided
by
theoretical
consideration
,
I
thought
that
some
interesting
results
might
be
obtained
in
regard
to
the
nature
and
relations
of
the
species
which
vary
most
,
by
tabulating
all
the
varieties
in
several
well
worked
floras
.
At
first
this
seemed
a
simple
task
;
but
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
,
to
whom
I
am
much
indebted
for
valuable
advice
and
assistance
on
this
subject
,
soon
convinced
me
that
there
were
many
difficulties
,
as
did
subsequently
Dr
.
Hooker
,
even
in
stronger
terms
.
I
shall
reserve
for
a
future
work
the
discussion
of
these
difficulties
,
and
the
tables
of
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
varying
species
.
Dr
.
Hooker
permits
me
to
add
that
after
having
carefully
read
my
manuscript
,
and
examined
the
tables
,
he
thinks
that
the
following
statements
are
fairly
well
established
.
The
whole
subject
,
however
,
treated
as
it
necessarily
here
is
with
much
brevity
,
is
rather
perplexing
,
and
allusions
cannot
be
avoided
to
the
"
struggle
for
existence
,
"
"
divergence
of
character
,
"
and
other
questions
,
hereafter
to
be
discussed
.
Alphonse
de
Candolle
and
others
have
shown
that
plants
which
have
very
wide
ranges
generally
present
varieties
;
and
this
might
have
been
expected
,
as
they
are
exposed
to
diverse
physical
conditions
,
and
as
they
come
into
competition
(
which
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
is
an
equally
or
more
important
circumstance
)
with
different
sets
of
organic
beings
.
But
my
tables
further
show
that
,
in
any
limited
country
,
the
species
which
are
the
most
common
,
that
is
abound
most
in
individuals
,
and
the
species
which
are
most
widely
diffused
within
their
own
country
(
and
this
is
a
different
consideration
from
wide
range
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
from
commonness
)
,
oftenest
give
rise
to
varieties
sufficiently
well
marked
to
have
been
recorded
in
botanical
works
.
Hence
it
is
the
most
flourishing
,
or
,
as
they
may
be
called
,
the
dominant
species
,
those
which
range
widely
,
are
the
most
diffused
in
their
own
country
,
and
are
the
most
numerous
in
individuals
,
which
oftenest
produce
well
marked
varieties
,
or
,
as
I
consider
them
,
incipient
species
.
And
this
,
perhaps
,
might
have
been
anticipated
;
for
as
varieties
,
in
order
to
become
in
any
degree
permanent
,
necessarily
have
to
struggle
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
country
,
the
species
which
are
already
dominant
will
be
the
most
likely
to
yield
offspring
,
which
,
though
in
some
slight
degree
modified
,
still
inherit
those
advantages
that
enabled
their
parents
to
become
dominant
over
their
compatriots
.
In
these
remarks
on
predominance
,
it
should
be
understood
that
reference
is
made
only
to
the
forms
which
come
into
competition
with
each
other
,
and
more
especially
to
the
members
of
the
same
genus
or
class
having
nearly
similar
habits
of
life
.
With
respect
to
the
number
of
individuals
or
commonness
of
species
,
the
comparison
of
course
relates
only
to
the
members
of
the
same
group
.
One
of
the
higher
plants
may
be
said
to
be
dominant
if
it
be
more
numerous
in
individuals
and
more
widely
diffused
than
the
other
plants
of
the
same
country
,
which
live
under
nearly
the
same
conditions
.
A
plant
of
this
kind
is
not
the
less
dominant
because
some
conferva
inhabiting
the
water
or
some
parasitic
fungus
is
infinitely
more
numerous
in
individuals
and
more
widely
diffused
.
But
if
the
conferva
or
parasitic
fungus
exceeds
its
allies
in
the
above
respects
,
it
will
then
be
dominant
within
its
own
class
.
Species
of
the
Larger
Genera
in
each
Country
vary
more
frequently
than
the
Species
of
the
Smaller
Genera
If
the
plants
inhabiting
a
country
,
as
described
in
any
Flora
,
be
divided
into
two
equal
masses
,
all
those
in
the
larger
genera
(
i
.
e
.
,
those
including
many
species
)
being
placed
on
one
side
,
and
all
those
in
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
,
the
former
will
be
found
to
include
a
somewhat
larger
number
of
the
very
common
and
much
diffused
or
dominant
species
.
This
might
have
been
anticipated
;
for
the
mere
fact
of
many
species
of
the
same
genus
inhabiting
any
country
,
shows
that
there
is
something
in
the
organic
or
inorganic
conditions
of
that
country
favourable
to
the
genus
;
and
,
consequently
,
we
might
have
expected
to
have
found
in
the
larger
genera
or
those
including
many
species
,
a
larger
proportional
number
of
dominant
species
.
But
so
many
causes
tend
to
obscure
this
result
,
that
I
am
surprised
that
my
tables
show
even
a
small
majority
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
.
I
will
here
allude
to
only
two
causes
of
obscurity
.
Fresh
water
and
salt
loving
plants
generally
have
very
wide
ranges
and
are
much
diffused
,
but
this
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
nature
of
the
stations
inhabited
by
them
,
and
has
little
or
no
relation
to
the
size
of
the
genera
to
which
the
species
belong
.
Again
,
plants
low
in
the
scale
of
organisation
are
generally
much
more
widely
diffused
than
plants
higher
in
the
scale
;
and
here
again
there
is
no
close
relation
to
the
size
of
the
genera
.
The
cause
of
lowly
organised
plants
ranging
widely
will
be
discussed
in
our
chapter
on
Geographical
Distribution
.
From
looking
at
species
as
only
strongly
marked
and
well
defined
varieties
,
I
was
led
to
anticipate
that
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
in
each
country
would
oftener
present
varieties
,
than
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
;
for
wherever
many
closely
related
species
(

,
species
of
the
same
genus
)
have
been
formed
,
many
varieties
or
incipient
species
ought
,
as
a
general
rule
,
to
be
now
forming
.
Where
many
large
trees
grow
,
we
expect
to
find
saplings
.
Where
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
through
variation
,
circumstances
have
been
favourable
for
variation
;
and
hence
we
might
expect
that
the
circumstances
would
generally
be
still
favourable
to
variation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
a
special
act
of
creation
,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
more
varieties
should
occur
in
a
group
having
many
species
,
than
in
one
having
few
.
To
test
the
truth
of
this
anticipation
I
have
arranged
the
plants
of
twelve
countries
,
and
the
coleopterous
insects
of
two
districts
,
into
two
nearly
equal
masses
,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
on
one
side
,
and
those
of
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
,
and
it
has
invariably
proved
to
be
the
case
that
a
larger
proportion
of
the
species
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
presented
varieties
,
than
on
the
side
of
the
smaller
genera
.
Moreover
,
the
species
of
the
large
genera
which
present
any
varieties
,
invariably
present
a
larger
average
number
of
varieties
than
do
the
species
of
the
small
genera
.
Both
these
results
follow
when
another
division
is
made
,
and
when
all
the
least
genera
,
with
from
only
one
to
four
species
,
are
altogether
excluded
from
the
tables
.
These
facts
are
of
plain
signification
on
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
;
for
wherever
many
species
of
the
same
genus
have
been
formed
,
or
where
,
if
we
may
use
the
expression
,
the
manufactory
of
species
has
been
active
,
we
ought
generally
to
find
the
manufactory
still
in
action
,
more
especially
as
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
the
process
of
manufacturing
new
species
to
be
a
slow
one
.
And
this
certainly
holds
true
,
if
varieties
be
looked
at
as
incipient
species
;
for
my
tables
clearly
show
as
a
general
rule
that
,
wherever
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
,
the
species
of
that
genus
present
a
number
of
varieties
,
that
is
of
incipient
species
,
beyond
the
average
.
It
is
not
that
all
large
genera
are
now
varying
much
,
and
are
thus
increasing
in
the
number
of
their
species
,
or
that
no
small
genera
are
now
varying
and
increasing
;
for
if
this
had
been
so
,
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
my
theory
;
inasmuch
as
geology
plainly
tells
us
that
small
genera
have
in
the
lapse
of
time
often
increased
greatly
in
size
;
and
that
large
genera
have
often
come
to
their
maxima
,
declined
,
and
disappeared
.
All
that
we
want
to
show
is
,
that
when
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
,
on
an
average
many
are
still
forming
;
and
this
certainly
holds
good
.
Many
of
the
Species
included
within
the
Larger
Genera
resemble
Varieties
in
being
very
closely
,
but
unequally
,
related
to
each
other
,
and
in
having
restricted
ranges
There
are
other
relations
between
the
species
of
large
genera
and
their
recorded
varieties
which
deserve
notice
.
We
have
seen
that
there
is
no
infallible
criterion
by
which
to
distinguish
species
and
well
marked
varieties
;
and
when
intermediate
links
have
not
been
found
between
doubtful
forms
,
naturalists
are
compelled
to
come
to
a
determination
by
the
amount
of
difference
between
them
,
judging
by
analogy
whether
or
not
the
amount
suffices
to
raise
one
or
both
to
the
rank
of
species
.
Hence
the
amount
of
difference
is
one
very
important
criterion
in
settling
whether
two
forms
should
be
ranked
as
species
or
varieties
.
Now
Fries
has
remarked
in
regard
to
plants
,
and
Westwood
in
regard
to
insects
,
that
in
large
genera
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
species
is
often
exceedingly
small
.
I
have
endeavoured
to
test
this
numerically
by
averages
,
and
,
as
far
as
my
imperfect
results
go
,
they
confirm
the
view
.
I
have
also
consulted
some
sagacious
and
experienced
observers
,
and
,
after
deliberation
,
they
concur
in
this
view
.
In
this
respect
,
therefore
,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
resemble
varieties
,
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
.
Or
the
case
may
be
put
in
another
way
,
and
it
may
be
said
,
that
in
the
larger
genera
,
in
which
a
number
of
varieties
or
incipient
species
greater
than
the
average
are
now
manufacturing
,
many
of
the
species
already
manufactured
still
to
a
certain
extent
resemble
varieties
,
for
they
differ
from
each
other
by
less
than
the
usual
amount
of
difference
.
Moreover
,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
are
related
to
each
other
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
related
to
each
other
.
No
naturalist
pretends
that
all
the
species
of
a
genus
are
equally
distinct
from
each
other
;
they
may
generally
be
divided
into
sub
genera
,
or
sections
,
or
lesser
groups
.
As
Fries
has
well
remarked
,
little
groups
of
species
are
generally
clustered
like
satellites
around
other
species
.
And
what
are
varieties
but
groups
of
forms
,
unequally
related
to
each
other
,
and
clustered
round
certain
forms
that
is
,
round
their
parent
species
.
Undoubtedly
there
is
one
most
important
point
of
difference
between
varieties
and
species
;
namely
,
that
the
amount
of
difference
between
varieties
,
when
compared
with
each
other
or
with
their
parent
species
,
is
much
less
than
that
between
the
species
of
the
same
genus
.
But
when
we
come
to
discuss
the
principle
,
as
I
call
it
,
of
Divergence
of
Character
,
we
shall
see
how
this
may
be
explained
,
and
how
the
lesser
differences
between
varieties
tend
to
increase
into
the
greater
differences
between
species
.
There
is
one
other
point
which
is
worth
notice
.
Varieties
generally
have
much
restricted
ranges
:
this
statement
is
indeed
scarcely
more
than
a
truism
,
for
,
if
a
variety
were
found
to
have
a
wider
range
than
that
of
its
supposed
parent
species
,
their
denominations
would
be
reversed
.
But
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
species
which
are
very
closely
allied
to
other
species
,
and
in
so
far
resemble
varieties
,
often
have
much
restricted
ranges
.
For
instance
,
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
has
marked
for
me
in
the
well
sifted
London
Catalogue
of
Plants
(
4th
edition
)
63
plants
which
are
therein
ranked
as
species
,
but
which
he
considers
as
so
closely
allied
to
other
species
as
to
be
of
doubtful
value
:
these
63
reputed
species
range
on
an
average
over
6
.
9
of
the
provinces
into
which
Mr
.
Watson
has
divided
Great
Britain
.
Now
,
in
this
same
Catalogue
,
53
acknowledged
varieties
are
recorded
,
and
these
range
over
7
.
7
provinces
;
whereas
,
the
species
to
which
these
varieties
belong
range
over
14
.
3
provinces
.
So
that
the
acknowledged
varieties
have
nearly
the
same
,
restricted
average
range
,
as
have
the
closely
allied
forms
,
marked
for
me
by
Mr
.
Watson
as
doubtful
species
,
but
which
are
almost
universally
ranked
by
British
botanists
as
good
and
true
species
.
Summary
Finally
,
varieties
cannot
be
distinguished
from
species
,
except
,
first
,
by
the
discovery
of
intermediate
linking
forms
;
and
,
secondly
,
by
a
certain
indefinite
amount
of
difference
between
them
;
for
two
forms
,
if
differing
very
little
,
are
generally
ranked
as
varieties
,
notwithstanding
that
they
cannot
be
closely
connected
;
but
the
amount
of
difference
considered
necessary
to
give
to
any
two
forms
the
rank
of
species
cannot
be
defined
.
In
genera
having
more
than
the
average
number
of
species
in
any
country
,
the
species
of
these
genera
have
more
than
the
average
number
of
varieties
.
In
large
genera
the
species
are
apt
to
be
closely
,
but
unequally
,
allied
together
,
forming
little
clusters
round
other
species
.
Species
very
closely
allied
to
other
species
apparently
have
restricted
ranges
.
In
all
these
respects
the
species
of
large
genera
present
a
strong
analogy
with
varieties
.
And
we
can
clearly
understand
these
analogies
,
if
species
once
existed
as
varieties
,
and
thus
originated
;
whereas
,
these
analogies
are
utterly
inexplicable
if
species
are
independent
creations
.
We
have
,
also
,
seen
that
it
is
the
most
flourishing
or
dominant
species
of
the
larger
genera
within
each
class
which
on
an
average
yield
the
greatest
number
of
varieties
;
and
varieties
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
tend
to
become
converted
into
new
and
distinct
species
.
Thus
the
larger
genera
tend
to
become
larger
;
and
throughout
nature
the
forms
of
life
which
are
now
dominant
tend
to
become
still
more
dominant
by
leaving
many
modified
and
dominant
descendants
.
But
by
steps
hereafter
to
be
explained
,
the
larger
genera
also
tend
to
break
u
into
smaller
genera
.
And
thus
,
the
forms
of
life
throughout
the
universe
become
divided
into
groups
subordinate
to
groups
.
CHAPTER
III
STRUGGLE
FOR
EXISTENCE
BEFORE
entering
on
the
subject
of
this
chapter
,
I
must
make
a
few
preliminary
remarks
,
to
show
how
the
struggle
for
existence
bears
on
Natural
Selection
.
It
has
been
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
amongst
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
there
is
some
individual
variability
:
indeed
I
am
not
aware
that
this
has
ever
been
disputed
.
It
is
immaterial
for
us
whether
a
multitude
of
doubtful
forms
be
called
species
or
sub
species
or
varieties
;
what
rank
,
for
instance
,
the
two
or
three
hundred
doubtful
forms
of
British
plants
are
entitled
to
hold
,
if
the
existence
of
any
well
marked
varieties
be
admitted
.
But
the
mere
existence
of
individual
variability
and
of
some
few
well
marked
varieties
,
though
necessary
as
the
foundation
for
the
work
,
helps
us
but
little
in
understanding
how
species
arise
in
nature
.
How
have
all
those
exquisite
adaptations
of
one
part
of
the
organisation
to
another
part
,
and
to
the
conditions
of
life
,
and
of
one
organic
being
to
another
being
,
been
perfected
?
We
see
these
beautiful
co
adaptations
most
plainly
in
the
woodpecker
and
the
mistletoe
;
and
only
a
little
less
plainly
in
the
humblest
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hairs
of
a
quadruped
or
feathers
of
a
bird
;
in
the
structure
of
the
beetle
which
dives
through
the
water
;
in
the
plumed
seed
which
is
wafted
by
the
gentlest
breeze
;
in
short
,
we
see
beautiful
adaptations
everywhere
and
in
every
part
of
the
organic
world
.
Again
,
it
may
be
asked
,
how
is
it
that
varieties
,
which
I
have
called
incipient
species
,
become
ultimately
converted
into
good
and
distinct
species
which
in
most
cases
obviously
differ
from
each
other
far
more
than
do
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
?
How
do
those
groups
of
species
,
which
constitute
what
are
called
distinct
genera
,
and
which
differ
from
each
other
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
same
genus
,
arise
?
All
these
results
,
as
we
shall
more
fully
see
in
the
next
chapter
,
follow
from
the
struggle
for
life
.
Owing
to
this
struggle
,
variations
,
however
slight
and
from
whatever
cause
proceeding
,
if
they
be
in
any
degree
profitable
to
the
individuals
of
a
species
,
in
their
infinitely
complex
relations
to
other
organic
beings
and
to
their
physical
conditions
of
life
,
will
tend
to
the
preservation
of
such
individuals
,
and
will
generally
be
inherited
by
the
offspring
.
The
offspring
,
also
,
will
thus
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
,
for
,
of
the
many
individuals
of
any
species
which
are
periodically
born
,
but
a
small
number
can
survive
.
I
have
called
this
principle
,
by
which
each
slight
variation
,
if
useful
,
is
preserved
,
by
the
term
Natural
Selection
,
in
order
to
mark
its
relation
to
man's
power
of
selection
.
But
the
expression
often
used
by
Mr
.
Herbert
Spencer
of
the
Survival
of
the
Fittest
is
more
accurate
,
and
is
sometimes
equally
convenient
.
We
have
seen
that
man
by
selection
can
certainly
produce
great
results
,
and
can
adapt
organic
beings
to
his
own
uses
,
through
the
accumulation
of
slight
but
useful
variations
,
given
to
him
by
the
hand
of
Nature
.
But
Natural
Selection
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
is
a
power
incessantly
ready
for
action
,
and
is
as
immeasurably
superior
to
man's
feeble
efforts
,
as
the
works
of
Nature
are
to
those
of
Art
.
We
will
now
discuss
in
a
little
more
detail
the
struggle
for
existence
.
In
my
future
work
this
subject
will
be
treated
,
as
it
well
deserves
,
at
greater
length
.
The
elder
De
Candolle
and
Lyell
have
largely
and
philosophically
shown
that
all
organic
beings
are
exposed
to
severe
competition
.
In
regard
to
plants
,
no
one
has
treated
this
subject
with
more
spirit
and
ability
than
W
.
Herbert
,
Dean
of
Manchester
,
evidently
the
result
of
his
great
horticultural
knowledge
.
Nothing
is
easier
than
to
admit
in
words
the
truth
of
the
universal
struggle
for
life
,
or
more
difficult
at
least
I
have
found
it
so
than
constantly
to
bear
this
conclusion
in
mind
.
Yet
unless
it
be
thoroughly
engrained
in
the
mind
,
the
whole
economy
of
nature
,
with
every
fact
on
distribution
,
rarity
,
abundance
,
extinction
,
and
variation
,
will
be
dimly
seen
or
quite
misunderstood
.
We
behold
the
face
of
nature
bright
with
gladness
,
we
often
see
superabundance
of
food
;
we
do
not
see
or
we
forget
,
that
the
birds
which
are
idly
singing
round
us
mostly
live
on
insects
or
seeds
,
and
are
thus
constantly
destroying
life
;
or
we
forget
how
largely
these
songsters
,
or
their
eggs
,
or
their
nestlings
,
are
destroyed
by
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
;
we
do
not
always
bear
in
mind
,
that
,
though
food
may
be
now
superabundant
,
it
is
not
so
at
all
seasons
of
each
recurring
year
.
The
Term
,
Struggle
for
Existence
,
used
in
a
large
sense
I
should
premise
that
I
use
this
term
in
a
large
and
metaphorical
sense
including
dependence
of
one
being
on
another
,
and
including
(
which
is
more
important
)
not
only
the
life
of
the
individual
,
but
success
in
leaving
progeny
.
Two
canine
animals
,
in
a
time
of
dearth
may
be
truly
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
which
shall
get
food
and
live
.
But
a
plant
on
the
edge
of
a
desert
is
said
to
struggle
for
life
against
the
drought
,
though
more
properly
it
should
be
said
to
be
dependent
on
the
moisture
.
A
plant
which
annually
produces
a
thousand
seeds
,
of
which
only
one
of
an
average
comes
to
maturity
,
may
be
more
truly
said
to
struggle
with
the
plants
of
the
same
and
other
kinds
which
already
clothe
the
ground
.
The
mistletoe
is
dependent
on
the
apple
and
a
few
other
trees
,
but
can
only
in
a
far
fetched
sense
be
said
to
struggle
with
these
trees
,
for
,
if
too
many
of
these
parasites
grow
on
the
same
tree
,
it
languishes
and
dies
.
But
several
seedling
mistletoes
,
growing
close
together
on
the
same
branch
,
may
more
truly
be
said
to
struggle
with
each

As
the
mistletoe
is
disseminated
by
birds
,
its
existence
depends
on
them
;
and
it
may
methodically
be
said
to
struggle
with
other
fruit
bearing
plants
,
in
tempting
the
birds
to
devour
and
thus
disseminate
its
seeds
.
In
these
several
senses
,
which
pass
into
each
other
,
I
use
for
convenience'
sake
the
general
term
of
Struggle
for
Existence
.
Geometrical
Ratio
of
Increase
A
struggle
for
existence
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
rate
at
which
all
organic
beings
tend
to
increase
.
Every
being
,
which
during
its
natural
lifetime
produces
several
eggs
or
seeds
,
must
suffer
destruction
during
some
period
of
its
life
,
and
during
some
season
or
occasional
year
,
otherwise
,
on
the
principle
of
geometrical
increase
,
its
numbers
would
quickly
become
so
inordinately
great
that
no
country
could
support
the
product
.
Hence
,
as
more
individuals
are
produced
than
can
possibly
survive
,
there
must
in
every
case
be
a
struggle
for
existence
,
either
one
individual
with
another
of
the
same
species
,
or
with
the
individuals
of
distinct
species
,
or
with
the
physical
conditions
of
life
.
It
is
the
doctrine
of
Malthus
applied
with
manifold
force
to
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
;
for
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
artificial
increase
of
food
,
and
no
prudential
restraint
from
marriage
.
Although
some
species
may
be
now
increasing
,
more
or
less
rapidly
,
in
numbers
,
all
cannot
do
so
,
for
the
world
would
not
hold
them
.
There
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
organic
being
naturally
increases
at
so
high
a
rate
,
that
,
if
not
destroyed
,
the
earth
would
soon
be
covered
by
the
progeny
of
a
single
pair
.
Even
slow
breeding
man
has
doubled
in
twenty
five
years
,
and
at
this
rate
,
in
less
than
a
thousand
years
,
there
would
literally
not
be
standing
room
for
his
progeny
.
Linnaeus
has
calculated
that
if
an
annual
plant
produced
only
two
seeds
and
there
is
no
plant
so
unproductive
as
this
and
their
seedlings
next
year
produced
two
,
and
so
on
,
then
in
twenty
years
there
should
be
a
million
plants
.
The
elephant
is
reckoned
the
slowest
breeder
of
all
known
animals
,
and
I
have
taken
some
pains
to
estimate
its
probable
minimum
rate
of
natural
increase
;
it
will
be
safest
to
assume
that
it
begins
breeding
when
thirty
years
old
,
and
goes
on
breeding
till
ninety
years
old
,
bringing
forth
six
young
in
the
interval
,
and
surviving
till
one
hundred
years
old
;
if
this
be
so
,
after
a
period
of
from
740
to
750
years
there
would
be
nearly
nineteen
million
elephants
alive
,
descended
from
the
first
pair
.
But
we
have
better
evidence
on
this
subject
than
mere
theoretical
calculations
,
namely
,
the
numerous
recorded
cases
of
the
astonishingly
rapid
increase
of
various
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
,
when
circumstances
have
been
favourable
to
them
during
two
or
three
following
seasons
.
Still
more
striking
is
the
evidence
from
our
domestic
animals
of
many
kinds
which
have
run
wild
in
several
parts
of
the
world
;
if
the
statements
of
the
rate
of
increase
of
slow
breeding
cattle
and
horses
in
South
America
,
and
latterly
in
Australia
,
had
not
been
well
authenticated
,
they
would
have
been
incredible
.
So
it
is
with
plants
;
cases
could
be
given
of
introduced
plants
which
have
become
common
throughout
whole
islands
in
a
period
of
less
than
ten
years
.
Several
of
the
plants
,
such
as
the
cardoon
and
a
tall
thistle
,
which
are
now
the
commonest
over
the
whole
plains
of
La
Plata
,
clothing
square
leagues
of
surface
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
plant
,
have
been
introduced
from
Europe
;
and
there
are
plants
which
now
range
in
India
,
as
I
hear
from
Dr
.
Falconer
,
from
Cape
Comorin
to
the
Himalaya
,
which
have
been
imported
from
America
since
its
discovery
.
In
such
cases
,
and
endless
others
could
be
given
,
no
one
supposes
that
the
fertility
of
the
animals
or
plants
has
been
suddenly
and
temporarily
increased
in
any
sensible
degree
.
The
obvious
explanation
is
that
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
highly
favourable
,
and
that
there
has
consequently
been
less
destruction
of
the
old
and
young
,
and
that
nearly
all
the
young
have
been
enabled
to
breed
.
Their
geometrical
ratio
of
increase
,
the
result
of
which
never
fails
to
be
surprising
,
simply
explains
their
extraordinarily
rapid
increase
and
wide
diffusion
in
their
new
homes
.
In
a
state
of
nature
almost
every
full
grown
plant
annually
produces
seed
,
and
amongst
animals
there
are
very
few
which
do
not
annually
pair
.
Hence
we
may
confidently
assert
,
that
all
plants
and
animals
are
tending
to
increase
at
a
geometrical
ratio
,
that
all
would
rapidly
stock
every
station
in
which
they
could
anyhow
exist
,
and
that
this
geometrical
tendency
to
increase
must
.
be
checked
by
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
.
Our
familiarity
with
the
larger
domestic
animals
tends
,
I
think
,
to
mislead
us
:
we
see
no
great
destruction
falling
on
them
,
but
we
do
not
keep
in
mind
that
thousands
are
annually
slaughtered
for
food
,
and
that
in
a
state
of
nature
an
equal
number
would
have
somehow
to
be
disposed
of
.
The
only
difference
between
organisms
which
annually
produce
eggs
or
seeds
by
the
thousand
,
and
those
which
produce
extremely
few
,
is
,
that
the
slow
breeders
would
require
a
few
more
years
to
people
,
under
favourable
conditions
,
a
whole
district
,
let
it
be
ever
so
large
.
The
condor
lays
a
couple
of
eggs
and
the
ostrich
a
score
,
and
yet
in
the
same
country
the
condor
may
be
the
more
numerous
of
the
two
;
the
Fulmar
petrel
lays
but
one
egg
,
yet
it
is
believed
to
be
the
most
numerous
bird
in
the
world
.
One
fly
deposits
hundreds
of
eggs
,
and
another
,
like
the
hippobosca
,
a
single
one
;
but
this
difference
does
not
determine
how
many
individuals
of
the
two
species
can
be
supported
in
a
district
.
A
large
number
of
eggs
is
of
some
importance
to
those
species
which
depend
on
a
fluctuating
amount
of
food
,
for
it
allows
them
rapidly
to
increase
in
number
.
But
the
real
importance
of
a
large
number
of
eggs
or
seeds
is
to
make
up
for
much
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
;
and
this
period
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
is
an
early
one
.
If
an
animal
can
in
any
way
protect
its
own
eggs
or
young
,
a
small
number
may
be
produced
,
and
yet
the
average
stock
be
fully
kept
up
;
but
if
many
eggs
or
young
are
destroyed
,
many
must
be
produced
,
or
the
species
will
become
extinct
.
It
would
suffice
to
keep
up
the
full
number
of
a
tree
,
which
lived
on
an
average
for
a
thousand
years
,
if
a
single
seed
were
produced
once
in
a
thousand
years
,
supposing
that
this
seed
were
never
destroyed
,
and
could
be
ensured
to
germinate
in
a
fitting
place
.
So
that
,
in
all
cases
,
the
average
number
of
any
animal
or
plant
depends
only
indirectly
on
the
number
of
its
eggs
or
seeds
.
In
looking
at
Nature
,
it
is
most
necessary
to
keep
the
foregoing
considerations
always
in
mind
never
to
forget
that
every
single
organic
being
may
be
said
to
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to
increase
in
numbers
;
that
each
lives
by
a
struggle
at
some
period
of
its
life
;
that
heavy
destruction
inevitably
falls
either
on
the
young
or
old
,
during
each
generation
or
at
recurrent
intervals
.
Lighten
any
cheek
,
mitigate
the
destruction
ever
so
little
,
and
the
number
of
the
species
will
almost
instantaneously
increase
to
any
amount
.
Nature
of
the
Checks
to
Increase
The
causes
which
cheek
the
natural
tendency
of
each
species
to
increase
are
most
obscure
.
Look
at
the
most
vigorous
species
;
by
as
much
as
it
swarms
in
numbers
,
by
so
much
will
it
tend
to
increase
still
further
.
We
know
not
exactly
what
the
checks
are
even
in
a
single
instance
.
Nor
will
this
surprise
any
one
who
reflects
how
ignorant
we
are
on
this
head
,
even
in
regard
to
mankind
,
although
so
incomparably
better
known
than
any
other
animal
.
This
subject
of
the
checks
to
increase
has
been
ably
treated
by
several
authors
,
and
I
hope
in
a
future
work
to
discuss
it
at
considerable
length
,
more
especially
in
regard
to
the
feral
animals
of
South
America
.
Here
I
will
make
only
a
few
remarks
,
just
to
recall
to
the
reader's
mind
some
of
the
chief
points
.
Eggs
or
very
young
animals
seem
generally
to
suffer
most
,
but
this
is
not
invariably
the
case
.
With
plants
there
is
a
vast
destruction
of
seeds
,
but
,
from
some
observations
which
I
have
made
,
it
appears
that
the
seedlings
suffer
most
from
germinating
in
ground
already
thickly
stocked
with
other
plants
.
Seedlings
,
also
,
are
destroyed
in
vast
numbers
by
various
enemies
;
for
instance
,
on
a
piece
of
ground
three
feet
long
and
two
wide
,
dug
and
cleared
,
and
where
there
could
be
no
choking
from
other
plants
,
I
marked
all
the
seedlings
of
our
native
weeds
as
they
came
up
,
and
out
of
357
no
less
than
295
were
destroyed
,
chiefly
by
slugs
and
insects
.
If
turf
which
has
long
been
mown
,
and
the
case
would
be
the
same
with
turf
closely
browsed
by
quadrupeds
,
be
let
to
grow
,
the
more
vigorous
plants
gradually
kill
the
less
vigorous
,
though
fully
grown
plants
;
thus
out
of
twenty
species
growing
on
a
little
plot
of
mown
turf
(
three
feet
by
four
)
nine
species
perished
,
from
the
other
species
being
allowed
to
grow
up
freely
.
The
amount
of
food
for
each
species
of
course
gives
the
extreme
limit
to
which
each
can
increase
;
but
very
frequently
it
is
not
the
obtaining
food
,
but
the
serving
as
prey
to
other
animals
,
which
determines
the
average
numbers
of
a
species
.
Thus
,
there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
the
stock
of
partridges
,
grouse
,
and
hares
on
any
large
estate
depends
chiefly
on
the
destruction
of
vermin
.
If
not
one
head
of
game
were
shot
during
the
next
twenty
years
in
England
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
if
no
vermin
were
destroyed
,
there
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
less
game
than
at
present
,
although
hundreds
of
thousands
of
game
animals
are
now
annually
shot
.
On
the
other
hand
,
in
some
cases
,
as
with
the
elephant
,
none
are
destroyed
by
beasts
of
prey
;
for
even
the
tiger
in
India
most
rarely
dares
to
attack
a
young
elephant
protected
by
its
dam
.
Climate
plays
an
important
part
in
determining
the
average
number
of
a
species
,
and
periodical
seasons
of
extreme
cold
or
drought
seem
to
be
the
most
effective
of
all
checks
.
I
estimated
(
chiefly
from
the
greatly
reduced
numbers
of
nests
in
the
spring
)
that
the
winter
of
1854
5
destroyed
four
fifths
of
the
birds
in
my
own
grounds
;
and
this
is
a
tremendous
destruction
,
when
we
remember
that
ten
per
cent
is
an
extraordinarily
severe
mortality
from
epidemics
with
man
.
The
action
of
climate
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
quite
independent
of
the
struggle
for
existence
;
but
in
so
far
as
climate
chiefly
acts
in
reducing
food
,
it
brings
on
the
most
severe
struggle
between
the
individuals
,
whether
of
the
same
or
of
distinct
species
,
which
subsist
on
the
same
kind
of
food
.
Even
when
climate
,
for
instance
,
extreme
cold
,
acts
directly
,
it
will
be
the
least
vigorous
individuals
,
or
those
which
have
got
least
food
through
the
advancing
winter
,
which
will
suffer
most
.
When
we
travel
from
south
to
north
,
or
from
a
damp
region
to
a
dry
,
we
invariably
see
some
species
gradually
getting
rarer
and
rarer
,
and
finally
disappearing
;
and
the
change
of
climate
being
conspicuous
,
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
the
whole
effect
to
its
direct
action
.
But
this
is
a
false
view
;
we
forget
that
each
species
,
even
where
it
most
abounds
,
is
constantly
suffering
enormous
destruction
at
some
period
of
its
life
,
from
enemies
or
from
competitors
for
the
same
place
and
food
;
and
if
these
enemies
or
competitors
be
in
the
least
degree
favoured
by
any
slight
change
of
climate
,
they
will
increase
in
numbers
;
and
as
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
,
the
other
species
must
decrease
.
When
we
travel
southward
and
see
a
species
decreasing
in
numbers
,
we
may
feel
sure
that
the
cause
lies
quite
as
much
in
other
species
being
favoured
,
as
in
this
one
being
hurt
.
So
it
is
when
we
travel
northward
,
but
in
a
somewhat
lesser
degree
,
for
the
number
of
species
of
all
kinds
,
and
therefore
of
competitors
,
decreases
northwards
;
hence
in
going
northwards
,
or
in
ascending
a
mountain
,
we
far
oftener
meet
with
stunted
forms
,
due
to
the
directly
injurious
action
of
climate
,
than
we
do
in
proceeding
southwards
or
in
descending
a
mountain
.
When
we
reach
the
arctic
regions
,
or
snowcapped
summits
,
or
absolute
deserts
,
the
struggle
for
life
is
almost
exclusively
with
the
elements
.
That
climate
acts
in
main
part
indirectly
by
favouring
other
species
,
we
clearly
see
in
the
prodigious
number
of
plants
which
in
our
gardens
can
perfectly
well
endure
our
climate
,
but
which
never
become
naturalised
,
for
they
cannot
compete
with
our
native
plants
nor
resist
destruction
by
our
native
animals
.
When
a
species
,
owing
to
highly
favourable
circumstances
,
increases
inordinately
in
numbers
in
a
small
tract
,
epidemics
at
least
,
this
seems
generally
to
occur
with
our
game
animals
often
ensue
;
and
here
we
have
a
limiting
check
independent
of
the
struggle
for
life
.
But
even
some
of
these
so
called
epidemics
appear
to
be
due
to
parasitic
worms
,
which
have
from
some
cause
,
possibly
in
part
through
facility
of
diffusion
amongst
the
crowded
animals
,
been
disproportionally
favoured
:
and
here
comes
in
a
sort
of
struggle
between
the
parasite
and
its
prey
.
On
the
other
hand
,
in
many
cases
,
a
large
stock
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
relatively
to
the
numbers
of
its
enemies
,
is
absolutely
necessary
for
its
preservation
.
Thus
we
can
easily
raise
plenty
of
corn
and
rape
seed
,
&c
.
,
in
our
fields
,
because
the
seeds
are
in
great
excess
compared
with
the
number
of
birds
which
feed
on
them
;
nor
can
the
birds
,
though
having
a
super
abundance
of
food
at
this
one
season
,
increase
in
number
proportionally
to
the
supply
of
seed
,
as
their
numbers
are
checked
during
the
winter
;
but
any
one
who
has
tried
,
knows
how
troublesome
it
is
to
get
seed
from
a
few
wheat
or
other
such
plants
in
a
garden
:
I
have
in
this
case
lost
every
single
seed
.
This
view
of
the
necessity
of
a
large
stock
of
the
same
species
for
its
preservation
,
explains
,
I
believe
,
some
singular
facts
in
nature
,
such
as
that
of
very
rare
plants
being
sometimes
extremely
abundant
,
in
the
few
spots
where
they
do
exist
;
and
that
of
some
social
plants
being
social
,
that
is
abounding
in
individuals
,
even
on
the
extreme
verge
of
their
range
.
For
in
such
cases
,
we
may
believe
,
that
a
plant
could
exist
only
where
the
conditions
of
its
life
were
so
favourable
that
many
could
exist
together
,
and
thus
save
the
species
from
utter
destruction
.
I
should
add
that
the
good
effects
of
intercrossing
,
and
the
ill
effects
of
close
interbreeding
,
no
doubt
come
into
play
in
many
of
these
cases
;
but
I
will
not
here
enlarge
on
this
subject
.
Complex
Relations
of
all
Animals
and
Plants
to
each
other
in
the
Struggle
for
Existence
Many
cases
are
on
record
showing
how
complex
and
unexpected
are
the
checks
and
relations
between
organic
beings
,
which
have
to
struggle
together
in
the
same
country
.
I
will
give
only
a
single
instance
,
which
,
though
a
simple
one
,
interested
me
.
In
Staffordshire
,
on
the
estate
of
a
relation
,
where
I
had
ample
means
of
investigation
,
there
was
a
large
and
extremely
barren
heath
,
which
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
;
but
several
hundred
acres
of
exactly
the
same
nature
had
been
enclosed
twenty
five
years
previously
and
planted
with
Scotch
fir
.
The
change
in
the
native
vegetation
of
the
planted
part
of
the
heath
was
most
remarkable
,
more
than
is
generally
seen
in
passing
from
one
quite
different
soil
to
another
:
not
only
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
heath
plants
were
wholly
changed
,
but
twelve
species
of
plants
(
not
counting
grasses
and
carices
)
flourished
in
the
plantations
,
which
could
not
be
found
on
the
heath
.
The
effect
on
the
insects
must
have
been
still
greater
,
for
six
insectivorous
birds
were
very
common
in
the
plantations
,
which
were
not
to
be
seen
on
the
heath
;
and
the
heath
was
frequented
by
two
or
three
distinct
insectivorous
birds
.
Here
we
see
how
potent
has
been
the
effect
of
the
introduction
of
a
single
tree
,
nothing
whatever
else
having
been
done
,
with
the
exception
of
the
land
having
been
enclosed
,
so
that
cattle
could
not
enter
.
But
how
important
an
element
enclosure
is
,
I
plainly
saw
near
Farnham
,
in
Surrey
.
Here
there
are
extensive
heaths
,
with
a
few
clumps
of
old
Scotch
firs
on
the
distant
hilltops
:
within
the
last
ten
years
large
spaces
have
been
enclosed
,
and
self
sown
firs
are
now
springing
up
in
multitudes
,
so
close
together
that
all
cannot
live
.
When
I
ascertained
that
these
young
trees
had
not
been
sown
or
planted
,
I
was
so
much
surprised
at
their
numbers
that
I
went
to
several
points
of
view
,
whence
I
could
examine
hundreds
of
acres
of
the
unenclosed
heath
,
and
literally
I
could
not
see
a
single
Scotch
fir
,
except
the
old
planted
clumps
.
But
on
looking
closely
between
the
stems
of
the
heath
,
I
found
a
multitude
of
seedlings
and
little
trees
which
had
been
perpetually
browsed
down
by
the
cattle
.
In
one
square
yard
,
at
a
point
some
hundred
yards
distant
from
one
of
the
old
clumps
,
I
counted
thirty
two
little
trees
;
and
one
of
them
,
with
twenty
six
rings
of
growth
,
had
,
during
many
years
,
tried
to
raise
its
head
above
the
stems
of
the
heath
,
and
had
failed
.
No
wonder
that
,
as
soon
as
the
land
was
enclosed
,
it
became
thickly
clothed
with
vigorously
growing
young
firs
.
Yet
the
heath
was
so
extremely
barren
and
so
extensive
that
no
one
would
ever
have
imagined
that
cattle
would
have
so
closely
and
effectually
searched
it
for
food
.
Here
we
see
that
cattle
absolutely
determine
the
existence
of
the
Scotch
fir
;
but
in
several
parts
of
the
world
insects
determine
the
existence
of
cattle
.
Perhaps
Paraguay
offers
the
most
curious
instance
of
this
;
for
here
neither
cattle
nor
horses
nor
dogs
have
ever
run
wild
,
though
they
swarm
southward
and
northward
in
a
feral
state
;
and
Azara
and
Rengger
have
shown
that
this
is
caused
by
the
greater
number
in
Paraguay
of
a
certain
fly
,
which
lays
its
eggs
in
the
navels
of
these
animals
when
first
born
.
The
increase
of
these
flies
,
numerous
as
they
are
,
must
be
habitually
checked
by
some
means
,
probably
by
other
parasitic
insects
.
Hence
,
if
certain
insectivorous
birds
were
to
decrease
in
Paraguay
,
the
parasitic
insects
would
probably
increase
;
and
this
would
lessen
the
number
of
the
navel
frequenting
flies
then
cattle
and
horses
would
become
feral
,
and
this
would
certainly
greatly
alter
(
as
indeed
I
have
observed
in
parts
of
South
America
)
the
vegetation
:
this
again
would
largely
affect
the
insects
;
and
this
,
as
we
have
just
seen
in
Staffordshire
,
the
insectivorous
birds
,
and
so
onwards
in
ever
increasing
circles
of
complexity
.
Not
that
under
nature
the
relations
will
ever
be
as
simple
as
this
.
Battle
within
battle
must
be
continually
recurring
with
varying
success
;
and
yet
in
the
long
run
the
forces
are
so
nicely
balanced
,
that
the
face
of
nature
remains
for
long
periods
of
time
uniform
,
though
assuredly
the
merest
trifle
would
give
the
victory
to
one
organic
being
over
another
.
Nevertheless
,
so
profound
is
our
ignorance
,
and
so
high
our
presumption
,
that
we
marvel
when
we
hear
of
the
extinction
of
an
organic
being
;
and
as
we
do
not
see
the
cause
,
we
invoke
cataclysms
to
desolate
the
world
,
or
invent
laws
on
the
duration
of
the
forms
of
life!
I
am
tempted
to
give
one
more
instance
showing
how
plants
and
animals
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
,
are
bound
together
by
a
web
of
complex
relations
.
I
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
show
that
the
exotic
Lobelia
fulgens
is
never
visited
in
my
garden
by
insects
,
and
consequently
,
from
its
peculiar
structure
,
never
sets
a
seed
.
Nearly
all
our
orchidaceous
plants
absolutely
require
the
visits
of
insects
to
remove
their
pollen
masses
and
thus
to
fertilise
them
.
I
find
from
experiments
that
humble
bees
are
almost
indispensable
to
the
fertilisation
of
the
heartsease
(
Viola
tricolor
)
,
for
other
bees
do
not
visit
this
flower
.
I
have
also
found
that
the
visits
of
bees
are
necessary
for
the
fertilisation
of
some
kinds
of
clover
;
for
instance
,
90
heads
of
Dutch
clover
(
Trifolium
repens
)
yielded
2
,
290
seeds
,
but
20
other
heads
protected
from
bees
produced
not
one
.
Again
,
100
heads
of
red
clover
(
T
.
pratense
)
produced
2
,
700
seeds
,
but
the
same
number
of
protected
heads
produced
not
a
single
seed
.
Humble
bees
alone
visit
red
clover
,
as
other
bees
cannot
reach
the
nectar
.
It
has
been
suggested
that
moths
may
fertilise
the
clovers
;
but
I
doubt
whether
they
could
do
so
in
the
case
of
the
red
clover
,
from
their
weight
not
being
sufficient
to
depress
the
wing
petals
.
Hence
we
may
infer
as
highly
probable
that
,
if
the
whole
genus
of
humble
bees
became
extinct
or
very
rare
in
England
,
the
heartsease
and
red
clover
would
become
very
rare
,
or
wholly
disappear
.
The
number
of
humble
bees
in
any
district
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
number
of
field
mice
,
which
destroy
their
combs
and
nests
;
and
Col
.
Newman
,
who
has
long
attended
to
the
habits
of
humble
bees
,
believes
that
"
more
than
two
thirds
of
them
are
thus
destroyed
all
over
England
.
"
Now
the
number
of
mice
is
largely
dependent
,
as
every
one
knows
,
on
the
number
of
cats
;
and
Col
.
Newman
says
,
"
Near
villages
and
small
towns
I
have
found
the
nests
of
humble
bees
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
,
which
I
attribute
to
the
number
of
cats
that
destroy
the
mice
.
"
Hence
it
is
quite
credible
that
the
presence
of
a
feline
animal
in
large
numbers
in
a
district
might
determine
,
through
the
intervention
first
of
mice
and
then
of
bees
,
the
frequency
of
certain
flowers
in
that
district!
In
the
case
of
every
species
,
many
different
checks
,
acting
at
different
periods
of
life
,
and
during
different
seasons
or
years
,
probably
come
into
play
;
some
one
check
or
some
few
being
generally
the
most
potent
;
but
all
will
concur
in
determining
the
average
number
or
even
the
existence
of
the
species
.
In
some
cases
it
can
be
shown
that
widely
different
checks
act
on
the
same
species
in
different
districts
.
When
we
look
at
the
plants
and
bushes
clothing
an
entangled
bank
,
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
their
proportional
numbers
and
kinds
to
what
we
call
chance
.
But
how
false
a
view
is
this!
Every
one
has
heard
that
when
an
American
forest
is
cut
down
a
very
different
vegetation
springs
up
;
but
it
has
been
observed
that
ancient
Indian
ruins
in
the
southern
United
States
,
which
must
formerly
have
been
cleared
of
trees
,
now
display
the
same
beautiful
diversity
and
proportion
of
kinds
as
in
the
surrounding
virgin
forest
.
What
a
struggle
must
have
gone
on
during
long
centuries
between
the
several
kinds
of
trees
each
annually
scattering
its
seeds
by
the
thousand
;
what
war
between
insect
and
insect
between
insects
,
snails
,
and
other
animals
with
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
all
striving
to
increase
,
all
feeding
on
each
other
,
or
on
the
trees
,
their
seeds
and
seedlings
,
or
on
the
other
plants
which
first
clothed
the
ground
and
thus
checked
the
growth
of
the
trees!
Throw
up
a
handful
of
feathers
,
and
all
fall
to
the
ground
according
to
definite
laws
;
but
how
simple
is
the
problem
where
each
shall
fall
compared
to
that
of
the
action
and
reaction
of
the
innumerable
plants
and
animals
which
have
determined
,
in
the
course
of
centuries
,
the
proportional
numbers
and
kinds
of
trees
now
growing
on
the
old
Indian
ruins!
The
dependency
of
one
organic
being
on
another
,
as
of
a
parasite
on
its
prey
,
lies
generally
between
beings
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
.
This
is
likewise
sometimes
the
case
with
those
which
may
be
strictly
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
for
existence
,
as
in
the
case
of
locusts
and
grass
feeding
quadrupeds
.
But
the
struggle
will
almost
invariably
be
most
severe
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
for
they
frequent
the
same
districts
,
require
the
same
food
,
and
are
exposed
to
the
same
dangers
.
In
the
case
of
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
almost
equally
severe
,
and
we
sometimes
see
the
contest
soon
decided
:
for
instance
,
if
several
varieties
of
wheat
be
sown
together
,
and
the
mixed
seed
be
resown
,
some
of
the
varieties
which
best
suit
the
soil
or
climate
,
or
are
naturally
the
most
fertile
,
will
beat
the
others
and
so
yield
more
seed
,
and
will
consequently
in
a
few
years
supplant
the
other
varieties
.
To
keep
up
a
mixed
stock
of
even
such
extremely
close
varieties
as
the
variously
coloured
sweet
peas
,
they
must
be
each
year
harvested
separately
,
and
the
seed
then
mixed
in
due
proportion
,
otherwise
the
weaker
kinds
will
steadily
decrease
in
number
and
disappear
.
So
again
with
the
varieties
of
sheep
;
it
has
been
asserted
that
certain
mountain
varieties
will
starve
out
other
mountain
varieties
,
so
that
they
cannot
be
kept
together
.
The
same
result
has
followed
from
keeping
together
different
varieties
of
the
medicinal
leech
.
It
may
even
be
doubted
whether
the
varieties
of
any
of
our
domestic
plants
or
animals
have
so
exactly
the
same
strength
,
habits
,
and
constitution
,
that
the
original
proportions
of
a
mixed
stock
(
crossing
being
prevented
)
could
be
kept
up
for
half
a
dozen
generations
,
if
they
were
allowed
to
struggle
together
,
in
the
same
manner
as
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
,
and
if
the
seed
or
young
were
not
annually
preserved
in
due
proportion
.
Struggle
for
Life
most
severe
between
Individuals
and
Varieties
of
the
same
Species
As
the
species
of
the
same
genus
usually
have
,
though
by
no
means
invariably
,
much
similarity
in
habits
and
constitution
,
and
always
in
structure
,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
more
severe
between
them
,
if
they
come
into
competition
with
each
other
,
than
between
the
species
of
distinct
genera
.
We
see
this
in
the
recent
extension
over
parts
of
the
United
States
of
one
species
of
swallow
having
caused
the
decrease
of
another
species
.
The
recent
increase
of
the
missel
thrush
in
parts
of
Scotland
has
caused
the
decrease
of
the
song
thrush
.
How
frequently
we
hear
of
one
species
of
rat
taking
the
place
of
another
species
under
the
most
different
climates!
In
Russia
the
small
Asiatic
cockroach
has
everywhere
driven
before
it
its
great
congener
.
In
Australia
the
imported
hive
bee
is
rapidly
exterminating
the
small
,
stingless
native
bee
.
One
species
of
charlock
has
been
known
to
supplant
another
species
;
and
so
in
other
cases
.
We
can
dimly
see
why
the
competition
should
be
most
severe
between
allied
forms
,
which
fill
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
;
but
probably
in
no
one
case
could
we
precisely
say
why
one
species
has
been
victorious
over
another
in
the
great
battle
of
life
.
A
corollary
of
the
highest
importance
may
be
deduced
from
the
foregoing
remarks
,
namely
,
that
the
structure
of
every
organic
being
is
related
,
in
the
most
essential
yet
often
hidden
manner
,
to
that
of
all
the
other
organic
beings
,
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
for
food
or
residence
,
or
from
which
it
has
to
escape
,
or
on
which
it
preys
.
This
is
obvious
in
the
structure
of
the
teeth
and
talons
of
the
tiger
;
and
in
that
of
the
legs
and
claws
of
the
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hair
on
the
tiger's
body
.
But
in
the
beautifully
plumed
seed
of
the
dandelion
,
and
in
the
flattened
and
fringed
legs
of
the
water
beetle
,
the
relation
seems
at
first
confined
to
the
elements
of
air
and
water
.
Yet
the
advantage
of
plumed
seeds
no
doubt
stands
in
the
closest
relation
to
the
land
being
already
thickly
clothed
with
other
plants
;
so
that
the
seeds
may
be
widely
distributed
and
fall
on
unoccupied
ground
.
In
the
water
beetle
,
the
structure
of
its
legs
,
so
well
adapted
for
diving
,
allows
it
to
compete
with
other
aquatic
insects
,
to
hunt
for
its
own
prey
,
and
to
escape
serving
as
prey
to
other
animals
.
The
store
of
nutriment
laid
up
within
the
seeds
of
many
plants
seems
at
first
to
have
no
sort
of
relation
to
other
plants
.
But
from
the
strong
growth
of
young
plants
produced
from
such
seeds
,
as
peas
and
beans
,
when
sown
in
the
midst
of
long
grass
,
it
may
be
suspected
that
the
chief
use
of
the
nutriment
in
the
seed
is
to
favour
the
growth
of
the
seedlings
,
whilst
struggling
with
other
plants
growing
vigorously
all
around
.
Look
at
a
plant
in
the
midst
of
its
range
,
why
does
it
not
double
or
quadruple
its
numbers
?
We
know
that
it
can
perfectly
well
withstand
a
little
more
heat
or
cold
,
dampness
or
dryness
,
for
elsewhere
it
ranges
into
slightly
hotter
or
colder
,
damper
or
drier
districts
.
In
this
case
we
can
clearly
see
that
if
we
wish
in
imagination
to
give
the
plant
the
power
of
increasing
in
number
,
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
its
competitors
,
or
over
the
animals
which
prey
on
it
.
On
the
confines
of
its
geographical
range
,
a
change
of
constitution
with
respect
to
climate
would
clearly
be
an
advantage
to
our
plant
;
but
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
only
a
few
plants
or
animals
range
so
far
,
that
they
are
destroyed
exclusively
by
the
rigour
of
the
climate
.
Not
until
we
reach
the
extreme
confines
of
life
,
in
the
Arctic
regions
or
on
the
borders
of
an
utter
desert
,
will
competition
cease
.
The
land
may
be
extremely
cold
or
dry
,
yet
there
will
be
competition
between
some
few
species
,
or
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
for
the
warmest
or
dampest
spots
.
Hence
we
can
see
that
when
a
plant
or
animal
is
placed
in
a
new
country
amongst
new
competitors
,
the
conditions
of
its
life
will
generally
be
changed
in
an
essential
manner
,
although
the
climate
may
be
exactly
the
same
as
in
its
former
home
.
If
its
average
numbers
are
to
increase
in
its
new
home
,
we
should
have
to
modify
it
in
a
different
way
to
what
we
should
have
had
to
do
in
its
native
country
;
for
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
a
different
set
of
competitors
or
enemies
.
It
is
good
thus
to
try
in
imagination
to
give
to
any
one
species
an
advantage
over
another
.
Probably
in
no
single
instance
should
we
know
what
to
do
.
This
ought
to
convince
us
of
our
ignorance
on
the
mutual
relations
of
all
organic
beings
;
a
conviction
as
necessary
as
it
is
difficult
to
acquire
.
All
that
we
can
do
,
is
to
keep
steadily
in
mind
that
each
organic
being
is
striving
to
increase
in
a
geometrical
ratio
;
that
each
at
some
period
of
its
life
,
during
some
season
of
the
year
,
during
each
generation
or
at
intervals
,
has
to
struggle
for
life
and
to
suffer
great
destruction
.
When
we
reflect
on
this
struggle
,
we
may
console
ourselves
with
the
full
belief
,
that
the
war
of
nature
is
not
incessant
,
that
no
fear
is
felt
,
that
death
is
generally
prompt
,
and
that
the
vigorous
,
the
healthy
,
and
the
happy
survive
and
multiply
.
CHAPTER
IV
NATURAL
SELECTION
;
OR
THE
SURVIVAL
OF
THE
FITTEST
How
will
the
struggle
for
existence
,
briefly
discussed
in
the
last
chapter
,
act
in
regard
to
variation
?
Can
the
principle
of
selection
,
which
we
have
seen
is
so
potent
in
the
hands
of
man
,
apply
under
nature
?
I
think
we
shall
see
that
it
can
act
most
efficiently
.
Let
the
endless
number
of
slight
variations
and
individual
differences
occurring
in
our
domestic
productions
,
and
,
in
a
lesser
degree
,
in
those
under
nature
,
be
borne
in
mind
;
as
well
as
the
strength
of
the
hereditary
tendency
.
Under
domestication
,
it
may
be
truly
said
that
the
whole
organisation
becomes
in
some
degree
plastic
.
But
the
variability
,
which
we
almost
universally
meet
with
in
our
domestic
productions
,
is
not
directly
produced
,
as
Hooker
and
Asa
Gray
have
well
remarked
,
by
man
;
he
can
neither
originate
varieties
,
nor
prevent
their
occurrence
;
he
can
preserve
and
accumulate
such
as
do
occur
.
Unintentionally
he
exposes
organic
beings
to
new
and
changing
conditions
of
life
,
and
variability
ensues
;
but
similar
changes
of
conditions
might
and
do
occur
under
nature
.
Let
it
also
be
borne
in
mind
how
infinitely
complex
and
close
fitting
are
the
mutual
relations
of
all
organic
beings
to
each
other
and
to
their
physical
conditions
of
life
;
and
consequently
what
infinitely
varied
diversities
of
structure
might
be
of
use
to
each
being
under
changing
conditions
of
life
.
Can
it
,
then
,
be
thought
improbable
,
seeing
that
variations
useful
to
man
have
undoubtedly
occurred
,
that
other
variations
useful
in
some
way
to
each
being
in
the
great
and
complex
battle
of
life
,
should
occur
in
the
course
of
many
successive
generations
?
If
such
do
occur
,
can
we
doubt
(
remembering
that
many
more
individuals
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
)
that
individuals
having
any
advantage
,
however
slight
,
over
others
,
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
of
procreating
their
kind
?
On
the
other
hand
,
we
may
feel
sure
that
any
variation
in
the
least
degree
injurious
would
be
rigidly
destroyed
.
This
preservation
of
favourable
individual
differences
and
variations
,
and
the
destruction
of
those
which
are
injurious
,
I
have
called
Natural
Selection
,
or
the
Survival
of
the
Fittest
.
Variations
neither
useful
nor
injurious
would
not
be
affected
by
natural
selection
,
and
would
be
left
either
a
fluctuating
element
,
as
perhaps
we
see
in
certain
polymorphic
species
,
or
would
ultimately
become
fixed
,
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
organism
and
the
nature
of
the
conditions
.
Several
writers
have
misapprehended
or
objected
to
the
term
Natural
Selection
.
Some
have
even
imagined
that
natural
selection
induces
variability
,
whereas
it
implies
only
the
preservation
of
such
variations
as
arise
and
are
beneficial
to
the
being
under
its
conditions
of
life
.
No
one
objects
to
agriculturists
speaking
of
the
potent
effects
of
man's
selection
;
and
in
this
case
the
individual
differences
given
by
nature
,
which
man
for
some
object
selects
,
must
of
necessity
first
occur
.
Others
have
objected
that
the
term
selection
implies
conscious
choice
in
the
animals
which
become
modified
;
and
it
has
even
been
urged
that
,
as
plants
have
no
volition
,
natural
selection
is
not
applicable
to
them!
In
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
,
no
doubt
,
natural
selection
is
a
false
term
;
but
who
ever
objected
to
chemists
speaking
of
the
elective
affinities
of
the
various
elements
?
and
yet
an
acid
cannot
strictly
be
said
to
elect
the
base
with
which
it
in
preference
combines
.
It
has
been
said
that
I
speak
of
natural
selection
as
an
active
power
or
Deity
;
but
who
objects
to
an
author
speaking
of
the
attraction
of
gravity
as
ruling
the
movements
of
the
planets
?
Every
one
knows
what
is
meant
and
is
implied
by
such
metaphorical
expressions
;
and
they
are
almost
necessary
for
brevity
.
So
again
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
personifying
the
word
Nature
;
but
I
mean
by
Nature
,
only
the
aggregate
action
and
product
of
many
natural
laws
,
and
by
laws
the
sequence
of
events
as
ascertained
by
us
.
With
a
little
familiarity
such
superficial
objections
will
be
forgotten
.
We
shall
best
understand
the
probable
course
of
natural
selection
by
taking
the
case
of
a
country
undergoing
some
slight
physical
change
,
for
instance
,
of
climate
.
The
proportional
numbers
of
its
inhabitants
will
almost
immediately
undergo
a
change
,
and
some
species
will
probably
become
extinct
.
We
may
conclude
,
from
what
we
have
seen
of
the
intimate
and
complex
manner
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
each
country
are
bound
together
,
that
any
change
in
the
numerical
proportions
of
the
inhabitants
,
independently
of
the
change
of
climate
itself
,
would
seriously
affect
the
others
.
If
the
country
were
open
on
its
borders
,
new
forms
would
certainly
immigrate
,
and
this
would
likewise
seriously
disturb
the
relations
of
some
of
the
former
inhabitants
.
let
it
be
remembered
how
powerful
the
influence
of
a
single
introduced
tree
or
mammal
has
been
shown
to
be
.
But
in
the
case
of
an
island
,
or
of
a
country
partly
surrounded
by
barriers
,
into
which
new
and
better
adapted
forms
could
not
freely
enter
,
we
should
then
have
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
which
would
assuredly
be
better
filled
up
,
if
some
of
the
original
inhabitants
were
in
some
manner
modified
;
for
,
had
the
area
been
open
to
immigration
,
these
same
places
would
have
been
seized
on
by
intruders
.
In
such
cases
,
slight
modifications
,
which
in
any
way
favoured
the
individuals
of
any
species
,
by
better
adapting
them
to
their
altered
conditions
,
would
tend
to
be
preserved
;
and
natural
selection
would
have
free
scope
for
the
work
of
improvement
.
We
have
good
reason
to
believe
,
as
shown
in
the
first
chapter
,
that
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
give
a
tendency
to
increased
variability
;
and
in
the
foregoing
cases
the
conditions
have
changed
,
and
this
would
manifestly
be
favourable
to
natural
selection
,
by
affording
a
better
chance
of
the
occurrence
of
profitable
variations
.
Unless
such
occur
,
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
.
Under
the
term
of
"
variations
,
"
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
mere
individual
differences
are
included
.
As
man
can
produce
a
great
result
with
his
domestic
animals
and
plants
by
adding
up
in
any
given
direction
individual
differences
,
so
could
natural
selection
,
but
far
more
easily
from
having
incomparably
longer
time
for
action
.
Nor
do
I
believe
that
any
great
physical
change
,
as
of
climate
,
or
any
unusual
degree
of
isolation
to
check
immigration
,
is
necessary
in
order
that
new
and
unoccupied
places
should
be
left
,
for
natural
selection
to
fill
up
by
improving
some
of
the
varying
inhabitants
.
For
as
all
the
inhabitants
of
each
country
are
struggling
together
with
nicely
balanced
forces
,
extremely
slight
modifications
in
the
structure
or
habits
of
one
species
would
often
give
it
an
advantage
over
others
;
and
still
further
modifications
of
the
same
kind
would
often
still
further
increase
the
advantage
,
as
long
as
the
species
continued
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
and
profited
by
similar
means
of
subsistence
and
defence
.
No
country
can
be
named
in
which
all
the
native
inhabitants
are
now
so
perfectly
adapted
to
each
other
and
to
the
physical
conditions
under
which
they
live
,
that
none
of
them
could
be
still
better
adapted
or
improved
;
for
in
all
countries
,
the
natives
have
been
so
far
conquered
by
naturalised
productions
,
that
they
have
allowed
some
foreigners
to
take
firm
possession
of
the
land
.
And
as
foreigners
have
thus
in
every
country
beaten
some
of
the
natives
,
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
natives
might
have
been
modified
with
advantage
,
so
as
to
have
better
resisted
the
intruders
.
As
man
can
produce
,
and
certainly
has
produced
,
a
great
result
by
his
methodical
and
unconscious
means
of
selection
,
what
may
not
natural
selection
effect
?
Man
can
act
only
on
external
and
visible
characters
:
Nature
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
personify
the
natural
preservation
or
survival
of
the
fittest
,
cares
nothing
for
appearances
,
except
in
so
far
as
they
are
useful
to
any
being
.
She
can
act
on
every
internal
organ
,
on
every
shade
of
constitutional
difference
,
on
the
whole
machinery
of
life
.
Man
selects
only
for
his
own
good
:
Nature
only
for
that
of
the
being
which
she
tends
.
Every
selected
character
is
fully
exercised
by
her
,
as
is
implied
by
the
fact
of
their
selection
.
Man
keeps
the
natives
of
many
climates
in
the
same
country
;
he
seldom
exercises
each
selected
character
in
some
peculiar
and
fitting
manner
;
he
feeds
a
long
and
a
short
beaked
pigeon
on
the
same
food
;
he
does
not
exercise
a
long
backed
or
long
legged
quadruped
in
any
peculiar
manner
;
he
exposes
sheep
with
long
and
short
wool
to
the
same
climate
.
He
does
not
allow
the
most
vigorous
males
to
struggle
for
the
females
.
He
does
not
rigidly
destroy
all
inferior
animals
,
but
protects
during
each
varying
season
,
as
far
as
lies
in
his
power
,
all
his
productions
.
He
often
begins
his
selection
by
some
half
monstrous
form
;
or
at
least
by
some
modification
prominent
enough
to
catch
the
eye
or
to
be
plainly
useful
to
him
.
Under
nature
,
the
slightest
differences
of
structure
or
constitution
may
well
turn
the
nicely
balanced
scale
in
the
struggle
for
life
,
and
so
be
preserved
.
How
fleeting
are
the
wishes
and
efforts
of
man!
how
short
his
time!
and
consequently
how
poor
will
be
his
results
,
compared
with
those
accumulated
by
Nature
during
whole
geological
periods!
Can
we
wonder
,
then
,
that
Nature's
productions
should
be
far
"
truer
"
in
character
than
man's
productions
;
that
they
should
be
infinitely
better
adapted
to
the
most
complex
conditions
of
life
,
and
should
plainly
bear
the
stamp
of
far
higher
workmanship
?
It
may
metaphorically
be
said
that
natural
selection
is
daily
and
hourly
scrutinising
,
throughout
the
world
,
the
slightest
variations
;
rejecting
those
that
are
bad
,
preserving
and
adding
up
all
that
are
good
;
silently
and
insensibly
working
,
whenever
and
wherever
opportunity
offers
,
at
the
improvement
of
each
organic
being
in
relation
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
.
We
see
nothing
of
these
slow
changes
in
progress
,
until
the
hand
of
time
has
marked
the
lapse
of
ages
,
and
then
so
imperfect
is
our
view
into
long
past
geological
ages
,
that
we
see
only
that
the
forms
of
life
are
now
different
from
what
they
formerly
were
.
In
order
that
any
great
amount
of
modification
should
be
effected
in
a
species
,
a
variety
when
once
formed
must
again
,
perhaps
after
a
long
interval
of
time
,
vary
or
present
individual
differences
of
the
same
favourable
nature
as
before
;
and
these
must
be
again
preserved
,
and
so
onwards
step
by
step
.
Seeing
that
individual
differences
of
the
same
kind
perpetually
recur
,
this
can
hardly
be
considered
as
an
unwarrantable
assumption
.
But
whether
it
is
true
,
we
can
judge
only
by
seeing
how
far
the
hypothesis
accords
with
and
explains
the
general
phenomena
of
nature
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
ordinary
belief
that
the
amount
of
possible
variation
is
a
strictly
limited
quantity
is
likewise
a
simple
assumption
.
Although
natural
selection
can
act
only
through
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
,
yet
characters
and
structures
,
which
we
are
apt
to
consider
as
of
very
trifling
importance
,
may
thus
be
acted
on
.
When
we
see
leaf
eating
insects
green
,
and
bark
feeders
mottled
grey
;
the
alpine
ptarmigan
white
in
winter
,
the
red
grouse
the
colour
of
heather
,
we
must
believe
that
these
tints
are
of
service
to
these
birds
and
insects
in
preserving
them
from
danger
.
Grouse
,
if
not
destroyed
at
some
period
of
their
lives
,
would
increase
in
countless
numbers
;
they
are
known
to
suffer
largely
from
birds
of
prey
;
and
hawks
are
guided
by
eyesight
to
their
prey
so
much
so
,
that
on
parts
of
the
Continent
persons
are
warned
not
to
keep
white
pigeons
,
as
being
the
most
liable
to
destruction
.
Hence
natural
selection
might
be
effective
in
giving
the
proper
colour
to
each
kind
of
grouse
,
and
in
keeping
that
colour
,
when
once
acquired
,
true
and
constant
.
Nor
ought
we
to
think
that
the
occasional
destruction
of
an
animal
of
any
particular
colour
would
produce
little
effect
:
we
should
remember
how
essential
it
is
in
a
flock
of
white
sheep
to
destroy
a
lamb
with
the
faintest
trace
of
black
.
We
have
seen
how
the
colour
of
the
hogs
,
which
feed
on
the
"
paint
root
"
in
Virginia
,
determines
whether
they
shall
live
or
die
.
In
plants
,
the
down
on
the
fruit
and
the
colour
of
the
flesh
are
considered
by
botanists
as
characters
of
the
most
trifling
importance
:
yet
we
hear
from
an
excellent
horticulturist
,
Downing
,
that
in
the
United
States
,
smooth
skinned
fruits
suffer
far
more
from
a
beetle
,
a
Curculio
,
than
those
with
down
;
that
purple
plums
suffer
far
more
from
a
certain
disease
than
yellow
plums
;
whereas
another
disease
attacks
yellow
fleshed
peaches
far
more
than
those
with
other
coloured
flesh
.
If
,
with
all
the
aids
of
art
,
these
slight
differences
make
a
great
difference
in
cultivating
the
several
varieties
,
assuredly
,
in
a
state
of
nature
,
where
the
trees
would
have
to
struggle
with
other
trees
,
and
with
a
host
of
enemies
,
such
differences
would
effectually
settle
which
variety
,
whether
a
smooth
or
downy
,
a
yellow
or
purple
fleshed
fruit
,
should
succeed
.
In
looking
at
many
small
points
of
difference
between
species
,
which
,
as
far
as
our
ignorance
permits
us
to
judge
,
seem
quite
unimportant
,
we
must
not
forget
that
climate
,
food
,
&c
.
,
have
no
doubt
produced
some
direct
effect
.
It
is
also
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
,
owing
to
the
law
of
correlation
,
when
one
part
varies
,
and
the
variations
are
accumulated
through
natural
selection
,
other
modifications
,
often
of
the
most
unexpected
nature
,
will
ensue
.
As
we
see
that
those
variations
which
,
under
domestication
,
appear
at
any
particular
period
of
life
,
tend
to
reappear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period
;
for
instance
,
in
the
shape
,
size
,
and
flavour
of
the
seeds
of
the
many
varieties
of
our
culinary
and
agricultural
plants
;
in
the
caterpillar
and
cocoon
stages
of
the
varieties
of
the
silk
worm
;
in
the
eggs
of
poultry
,
and
in
the
colour
of
the
down
of
their
chickens
;
in
the
horns
of
our
sheep
and
cattle
when
nearly
adult
;
so
in
a
state
of
nature
natural
selection
will
be
enabled
to
act
on
and
modify
organic
beings
at
any
age
,
by
the
accumulation
of
variations
profitable
at
that
age
,
and
by
their
inheritance
at
a
corresponding
age
.
If
it
profit
a
plant
to
have
its
seeds
more
and
more
widely
disseminated
by
the
wind
,
I
can
see
no
greater
difficulty
in
this
being
effected
through
natural
selection
,
than
in
the
cotton
planter
increasing
and
improving
by
selection
the
down
in
the
pods
on
his
cotton
trees
.
Natural
selection
may
modify
and
adapt
the
larva
of
an
insect
to
a
score
of
contingencies
,
wholly
different
from
those
which
concern
the
mature
insect
;
and
these
modifications
may
affect
,
through
correlation
,
the
structure
of
the
adult
.
So
,
conversely
,
modifications
in
the
adult
may
affect
the
structure
of
the
larva
;
but
in
all
cases
natural
selection
will
ensure
that
they
shall
not
be
injurious
:
for
if
they
were
so
,
the
species
would
become
extinct
.
Natural
selection
will
modify
the
structure
of
the
young
in
relation
to
the
parent
,
and
of
the
parent
in
relation
to
the
young
.
In
social
animals
it
will
adapt
the
structure
of
each
individual
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
community
,
if
the
community
profits
by
the
selected
change
.
What
natural
selection
cannot
do
,
is
to
modify
the
structure
of
one
species
,
without
giving
it
any
advantage
,
for
the
good
Of
another
species
;
and
though
statements
to
this
effect
may
be
found
in
works
of
natural
history
,
I
cannot
find
one
case
which
will
bear
investigation
.
A
structure
used
only
once
in
an
animal's
life
,
if
of
high
importance
to
it
,
might
be
modified
to
any
extent
by
natural
selection
;
for
instance
,
the
great
jaws
possessed
by
certain
insects
,
used
exclusively
for
opening
the
cocoon
or
the
hard
tip
to
the
beak
of
unhatched
birds
,
used
for
breaking
the
egg
.
It
has
been
asserted
,
that
of
the
best
short
beaked
tumbler
pigeons
a
greater
number
perish
in
the
egg
than
are
able
to
get
out
of
it
;
so
that
fanciers
assist
in
the
act
of
hatching
.
Now
if
nature
had
to
make
the
beak
of
a
full
grown
pigeon
very
short
for
the
bird's
own
advantage
,
the
process
of
modification
would
be
very
slow
,
and
there
would
be
simultaneously
the
most
rigorous
selection
of
all
the
young
birds
within
the
egg
,
which
had
the
most
powerful
and
hardest
beaks
,
for
all
with
weak
beaks
would
inevitably
perish
;
or
,
more
delicate
and
more
easily
broken
shells
might
be
selected
,
the
thickness
of
the
shell
being
known
to
vary
like
every
other
structure
.
It
may
be
well
here
to
remark
that
with
all
beings
there
must
be
much
fortuitous
destruction
,
which
can
have
little
or
no
influence
on
the
course
of
natural
selection
.
For
instance
a
vast
number
of
eggs
or
seeds
are
annually
devoured
,
and
these
could
be
modified
through
natural
selection
only
if
they
varied
in
some
manner
which
protected
them
from
their
enemies
.
Yet
many
of
these
eggs
or
seeds
would
perhaps
,
if
not
destroyed
,
have
yielded
individuals
better
adapted
to
their
conditions
of
life
than
any
of
these
which
happened
to
survive
.
So
again
a
vast
number
of
mature
animals
and
plants
,
whether
or
not
they
be
the
best
adapted
to
their
conditions
,
must
be
annually
destroyed
by
accidental
causes
,
which
would
not
be
in
the
least
degree
mitigated
by
certain
changes
of
structure
or
constitution
which
would
in
other
ways
be
beneficial
to
the
species
.
But
let
the
destruction
of
the
adults
be
ever
so
heavy
,
if
the
number
which
can
exist
in
any
district
be
not
wholly
kept
down
by
such
causes
,
or
again
let
the
destruction
of
eggs
or
seeds
be
so
great
that
only
a
hundredth
or
a
thousandth
part
are
developed
,
yet
of
those
which
do
survive
,
the
best
adapted
individuals
,
supposing
that
there
is
any
variability
in
favourable
direction
,
will
tend
to
propagate
their
kind
in
larger
numbers
than
the
less
well
adapted
.
If
the
numbers
be
wholly
kept
down
by
the
causes
just
indicated
,
as
will
often
have
been
the
case
,
natural
selection
will
be
powerless
in
certain
beneficial
directions
;
but
this
is
no
valid
objection
to
its
efficiency
at
other
times
and
in
other
ways
;
for
we
are
far
from
having
any
reason
to
suppose
that
many
species
ever
undergo
modification
and
improvement
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
area
.
Sexual
Selection
Inasmuch
as
peculiarities
often
appear
under
domestication
in
one
sex
and
become
hereditarily
attached
to
that
sex
,
so
no
doubt
it
will
be
under
nature
.
Thus
it
is
rendered
possible
for
the
two
sexes
to
be
modified
through
natural
selection
in
relation
to
different
habits
of
life
,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
;
or
for
one
sex
to
be
modified
in
relation
to
the
other
sex
,
as
commonly
occurs
.
This
leads
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
what
I
have
called
Sexual
Selection
.
This
form
of
selection
depends
,
not
on
a
struggle
for
existence
in
relation
to
other
organic
beings
or
to
external
conditions
,
but
on
a
struggle
between
the
individuals
of
one
sex
,
generally
the
males
,
for
the
possession
of
the
other
sex
.
The
result
is
not
death
to
the
unsuccessful
competitor
,
but
few
or
no
offspring
.
Sexual
selection
is
,
therefore
,
less
rigorous
than
natural
selection
.
Generally
,
the
most
vigorous
males
,
those
which
are
best
fitted
for
their
places
in
nature
,
will
leave
most
progeny
.
But
in
many
cases
,
victory
depends
not
so
much
on
general
vigor
,
as
on
having
special
weapons
,
confined
to
the
male
sex
.
A
hornless
stag
or
spurless
cock
would
have
a
poor
chance
of
leaving
numerous
offspring
.
Sexual
selection
,
by
always
allowing
the
victor
to
breed
,
might
surely
give
indomitable
courage
,
length
to
the
spur
,
and
strength
to
the
wing
to
strike
in
the
spurred
leg
,
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
does
the
brutal
cockfighter
by
the
careful
selection
of
his
best
cocks
.
How
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
the
law
of
battle
descends
,
I
know
not
;
male
alligators
have
been
described
as
fighting
,
bellowing
,
and
whirling
round
,
like
Indians
in
a
war
dance
,
for
the
possession
of
the
females
;
male
salmons
have
been
observed
fighting
all
day
long
;
male
stagbeetles
sometimes
bear
wounds
from
the
huge
mandibles
of
other
males
;
the
males
of
certain
hymenopterous
insects
have
been
frequently
seen
by
that
inimitable
observer
M
.
Fabre
,
fighting
for
a
particular
female
who
sits
by
,
an
apparently
unconcerned
beholder
of
the
struggle
,
and
then
retires
with
the
conqueror
.
The
war
is
,
perhaps
,
severest
between
the
males
of
polygamous
animals
,
and
these
seem
oftenest
provided
with
special
weapons
.
The
males
of
carnivorous
animals
are
already
well
armed
;
though
to
them
and
to
others
,
special
means
of
defence
may
be
given
through
means
of
sexual
selection
,
as
the
mane
of
the
lion
,
and
the
hooked
jaw
to
the
male
salmon
;
for
the
shield
may
be
as
important
for
victory
,
as
the
sword
or
spear
.
Amongst
birds
,
the
contest
is
often
of
a
more
peaceful
character
.
All
those
who
have
attended
to
the
subject
,
believe
that
there
is
the
severest
rivalry
between
the
males
of
many
species
to
attract
,
by
singing
,
the
females
.
The
rock
thrush
of
Guiana
,
birds
of
paradise
,
and
some
others
,
congregate
;
and
successive
males
display
with
the
most
elaborate
care
,
and
show
off
in
the
best
manner
,
their
gorgeous
plumage
;
they
likewise
perform
strange
antics
before
the
females
,
which
,
standing
by
as
spectators
,
at
last
choose
the
most
attractive
partner
.
Those
who
have
closely
attended
to
birds
in
confinement
well
know
that
they
often
take
individual
preferences
and
dislikes
:
thus
Sir
R
.
Heron
has
described
how
a
pied
peacock
was
eminently
attractive
to
all
his
hen
birds
.
I
cannot
here
enter
on
the
necessary
details
;
but
if
man
can
in
a
short
time
give
beauty
and
an
elegant
carriage
to
his
bantams
,
according
to
his
standard
of
beauty
,
I
can
see
no
good
reason
to
doubt
that
female
birds
,
by
selecting
,
during
thousands
of
generations
,
the
most
melodious
or
beautiful
males
,
according
to
their
standard
of
beauty
,
might
produce
a
marked
effect
.
Some
well
known
laws
,
with
respect
to
the
plumage
of
male
and
female
birds
,
in
comparison
with
the
plumage
of
the
young
,
can
partly
be
explained
through
the
action
of
sexual
selection
on
variations
occurring
at
different
ages
,
and
transmitted
to
the
males
alone
or
to
both
sexes
at
corresponding
ages
;
but
I
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
subject
.
Thus
it
is
,
as
I
believe
,
that
when
the
males
and
females
of
any
animal
have
the
same
general
habits
of
life
,
but
differ
in
structure
,
colour
,
or
ornament
,
such
differences
have
been
mainly
caused
by
sexual
selection
:
that
is
,
by
individual
males
having
had
,
in
successive
generations
,
some
slight
advantage
over
other
males
,
in
their
weapons
,
means
of
defence
,
or
charms
,
which
they
have
transmitted
to
their
male
offspring
alone
.
Yet
,
I
would
not
wish
to
attribute
all
sexual
differences
to
this
agency
:
for
we
see
in
our
domestic
animals
peculiarities
arising
and
becoming
attached
to
the
male
sex
,
which
apparently
have
not
been
augmented
through
selection
by
man
.
The
tuft
of
hair
on
the
breast
of
the
wild
turkey
cock
cannot
be
of
any
use
,
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
can
be
ornamental
in
the
eyes
of
the
female
bird
;
indeed
,
had
the
tuft
appeared
under
domestication
,
it
would
have
been
called
a
monstrosity
.
Illustrations
of
the
Action
of
Natural
Selection
,
or
the
Survival
of
the
Fittest
In
order
to
make
it
clear
how
,
as
I
believe
,
natural
selection
acts
,
I
must
beg
permission
to
give
one
or
two
imaginary
illustrations
.
Let
us
take
the
case
of
a
wolf
,
which
preys
on
various
animals
,
securing
some
by
craft
,
some
by
strength
,
and
some
by
fleetness
;
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
fleetest
prey
,
a
deer
for
instance
,
had
from
any
change
in
the
country
increased
in
numbers
,
or
that
other
prey
had
decreased
in
numbers
,
during
that
season
of
the
year
when
the
wolf
was
hardest
pressed
for
food
.
Under
such
circumstances
the
swiftest
and
slimmest
wolves
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
so
be
preserved
or
selected
,
provided
always
that
they
retained
strength
to
master
their
prey
at
this
or
some
other
period
of
the
year
,
when
they
were
compelled
to
prey
on
other
animals
.
I
can
see
no
more
reason
to
doubt
that
this
would
be
the
result
,
than
that
man
should
be
able
to
improve
the
fleetness
of
his
greyhounds
by
careful
and
methodical
selection
,
or
by
that
kind
of
unconscious
selection
which
follows
from
each
man
trying
to
keep
the
best
dogs
without
any
thought
of
modifying
the
breed
.
I
may
add
,
that
,
according
to
Mr
.
Pierce
,
there
are
two
varieties
of
the
wolf
inhabiting
the
Catskill
Mountains
,
in
the
United
States
,
one
with
a
light
greyhound
like
form
,
which
pursues
deer
,
and
the
other
more
bulky
,
with
shorter
legs
,
which
more
frequently
attacks
the
shepherd's
flocks
.
It
should
be
observed
that
,
in
the
above
illustration
,
I
speak
of
the
slimmest
individual
wolves
,
and
not
of
any
single
strongly
marked
variation
having
been
preserved
.
In
former
editions
of
this
work
I
sometimes
spoke
as
if
this
latter
alternative
had
frequently
occurred
.
I
saw
the
great
importance
of
individual
differences
,
and
this
led
me
fully
to
discuss
the
results
of
unconscious
selection
by
man
,
which
depends
on
the
preservation
of
all
the
more
or
less
valuable
individuals
,
and
on
the
destruction
of
the
worst
.
I
saw
,
also
,
that
the
preservation
in
a
state
of
nature
of
any
occasional
deviation
of
structure
,
such
as
a
monstrosity
,
would
be
a
rare
event
;
and
that
,
if
at
first
preserved
,
it
would
generally
be
lost
by
subsequent
intercrossing
with
ordinary
individuals
.
Nevertheless
,
until
reading
an
able
and
valuable
article
in
the
North
British
Review
(
1867
)
,
I
did
not
appreciate
how
rarely
single
variations
,
whether
slight
or
strongly
marked
,
could
be
.
perpetuated
.
The
author
takes
the
case
of
a
pair
of
animals
,
producing
during
their
lifetime
two
hundred
offspring
,
of
which
,
from
various
causes
of
destruction
,
only
two
on
an
average
survive
to
procreate
their
kind
.
This
is
rather
an
extreme
estimate
for
most
of
the
higher
animals
,
but
by
no
means
so
for
many
of
the
lower
organisms
.
He
then
shows
that
if
a
single
individual
were
born
,
which
varied
in
some
manner
,
giving
it
twice
as
good
a
chance
of
life
as
that
of
the
other
individuals
,
yet
the
chances
would
be
strongly
against
its
survival
.
Supposing
it
to
survive
and
to
breed
,
and
that
half
its
young
inherited
the
favourable
variation
;
still
,
as
the
reviewer
goes
on
to
show
,
the
young
would
have
only
a
slightly
better
chance
of
surviving
and
breeding
;
and
this
chance
would
go
on
decreasing
in
the
succeeding
generations
.
The
justice
of
these
remarks
cannot
,
I
think
,
be
disputed
.
If
,
for
instance
,
a
bird
of
some
kind
could
procure
its
food
more
easily
by
having
its
beak
curved
,
and
if
one
were
born
with
its
beak
strongly
curved
,
and
which
consequently
flourished
,
nevertheless
there
would
be
a
very
poor
chance
of
this
one
individual
perpetuating
its
kind
to
the
exclusion
of
the
common
form
;
but
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
,
judging
by
what
we
see
taking
place
under
domestication
,
that
this
result
would
follow
from
the
preservation
during
many
generations
of
a
large
number
of
individuals
with
more
or
less
strongly
curved
beaks
,
and
from
the
destruction
of
a
still
larger
number
with
the
straightest
beaks
.
It
should
not
,
however
,
be
overlooked
that
certain
rather
strongly
marked
variations
,
which
no
one
would
rank
as
mere
individual
differences
,
frequently
recur
owing
to
a
similar
organisation
being
similarly
acted
on
of
which
fact
numerous
instances
could
be
given
with
our
domestic
productions
.
In
such
cases
,
if
the
varying
individual
did
not
actually
transmit
to
its
offspring
its
newly
acquired
character
,
it
would
undoubtedly
transmit
to
them
,
as
long
as
the
existing
conditions
remained
the
same
,
a
still
stronger
tendency
to
vary
in
the
same
manner
.
There
can
also
be
little
doubt
that
the
tendency
to
vary
in
the
same
manner
has
often
been
so
strong
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
have
been
similarly
modified
without
the
aid
of
any
form
of
selection
.
Or
only
a
third
,
fifth
,
or
tenth
part
of
the
individuals
may
have
been
thus
affected
,
of
which
fact
several
instances
could
be
given
.
Thus
Graba
estimates
that
about
one
fifth
of
the
guillemots
in
the
Faroe
Islands
consist
of
a
variety
so
well
marked
,
that
it
was
formerly
ranked
as
a
distinct
species
under
the
name
of
Uria
lacrymans
.
In
cases
of
this
kind
,
if
the
variation
were
of
a
beneficial
nature
,
the
original
form
would
soon
be
supplanted
by
the
modified
form
,
through
the
survival
of
the
fittest
.
To
the
effects
of
intercrossing
in
eliminating
variations
of
all
kinds
,
I
shall
have
to
recur
;
but
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
most
animals
and
plants
keep
to
their
proper
homes
,
and
do
not
needlessly
wander
about
;
we
see
this
even
with
migratory
birds
,
which
almost
always
return
to
the
same
spot
.
Consequently
each
newly
formed
variety
would
generally
be
at
first
local
,
as
seems
to
be
the
common
rule
with
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
;
so
that
similarly
modified
individuals
would
soon
exist
in
a
small
body
together
,
and
would
often
breed
together
.
If
the
new
variety
were
successful
in
its
battle
for
life
,
it
would
slowly
spread
from
a
central
district
,
competing
with
and
conquering
the
unchanged
individuals
on
the
margins
of
an
ever
increasing
circle
.
It
may
be
worth
while
to
give
another
and
more
complex
illustration
of
the
action
of
natural
selection
.
Certain
plants
excrete
sweet
juice
,
apparently
for
the
sake
of
eliminating
something
injurious
from
the
sap
:
this
is
effected
,
for
instance
,
by
glands
at
the
base
of
the
stipules
in
some
Leguminosae
and
at
the
backs
of
the
leaves
of
the
common
laurel
.
This
juice
,
though
small
in
quantity
,
is
greedily
sought
by
insects
;
but
their
visits
do
not
in
any
way
benefit
the
plant
.
Now
,
let
us
suppose
that
the
juice
or
nectar
was
excreted
from
the
inside
of
the
flowers
of
a
certain
number
of
plants
of
any
species
.
Insects
in
seeking
the
nectar
would
get
dusted
with
pollen
,
and
would
often
transport
it
from
one
flower
to
another
.
The
flowers
of
two
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
would
thus
get
crossed
;
and
the
act
of
crossing
,
as
can
be
fully
proved
,
gives
rise
to
vigorous
seedlings
which
consequently
would
have
the
best
chance
of
flourishing
and
surviving
The
plants
which
produced
flowers
with
the
largest
glands
or
nectaries
,
excreting
most
nectar
,
would
oftenest
be
visited
by
insects
,
and
would
oftenest
be
crossed
;
and
so
in
the
long
run
would
gain
the
upper
hand
and
form
a
local
variety
.
The
flowers
,
also
,
which
had
their
stamens
and
pistils
placed
,
in
relation
to
the
size
and
habits
of
the
particular
insects
which
visited
them
,
so
as
to
favour
in
any
degree
the
transportal
of
the
pollen
,
would
likewise
be
favoured
.
We
might
have
taken
the
case
of
insects
visiting
flowers
for
the
sake
of
collecting
pollen
instead
of
nectar
;
and
as
pollen
is
formed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
fertilisation
,
its
destruction
appears
to
be
a
simple
loss
to
the
plant
;
yet
if
a
little
pollen
were
carried
,
at
first
occasionally
and
then
habitually
,
by
the
pollen
devouring
insects
from
flower
to
flower
,
and
a
cross
thus
effected
,
although
nine
tenths
of
the
pollen
were
destroyed
it
might
still
be
a
great
gain
to
the
plant
to
be
thus
robbed
;
and
the
individuals
which
produced
more
and
more
pollen
,
and
had
larger
anthers
,
would
be
selected
.
When
our
plant
,
by
the
above
process
long
continued
,
had
been
rendered
highly
attractive
to
insects
,
they
would
,
unintentionally
on
their
part
,
regularly
carry
pollen
from
flower
to
flower
;
and
that
they
do
this
effectually
,
I
could
easily
show
by
many
striking
facts
.
I
will
give
only
one
,
as
likewise
illustrating
one
step
in
the
separation
of
the
sexes
of
plants
.
Some
holly
trees
bear
only
male
flowers
,
which
have
four
stamens
producing
a
rather
small
quantity
of
pollen
,
and
a
rudimentary
pistil
;
other
holly
trees
bear
only
female
flowers
;
these
have
a
full
sized
pistil
,
and
four
stamens
with
shrivelled
anthers
,
in
which
not
a
grain
of
pollen
can
be
detected
.
Having
found
a
female
tree
exactly
sixty
yards
from
a
male
tree
,
I
put
the
stigmas
of
twenty
flowers
,
taken
from
different
branches
,
under
the
microscope
,
and
on
all
,
without
exception
,
there
were
a
few
pollen
grains
,
and
on
some
a
profusion
.
As
the
wind
had
set
for
several
days
from
the
female
to
the
male
tree
,
the
pollen
could
not
thus
have
been
carried
.
The
weather
had
been
cold
and
boisterous
,
and
therefore
not
favourable
to
bees
,
nevertheless
every
female
flower
which
I
examined
had
been
effectually
fertilised
by
the
bees
,
which
had
flown
from
tree
to
tree
in
search
of
nectar
.
But
to
return
to
our
imaginary
case
:
as
soon
as
the
plant
had
been
rendered
so
highly
attractive
to
insects
that
pollen
was
regularly
carried
from
flower
to
flower
,
another
process
might
commence
.
No
naturalist
doubts
the
advantage
of
what
has
been
called
the
"
physiological
division
of
labour
"
;
hence
we
may
believe
that
it
would
be
advantageous
to
a
plant
to
produce
stamens
alone
in
one
flower
or
on
one
whole
plant
,
and
pistils
alone
in
another
flower
or
on
another
plant
.
In
plants
under
culture
and
placed
under
new
conditions
of
life
,
sometimes
the
male
organs
and
sometimes
the
female
organs
become
more
or
less
impotent
;
now
if
we
suppose
this
to
occur
in
ever
so
slight
a
degree
under
nature
,
then
,
as
pollen
is
already
carried
regularly
from
flower
to
flower
,
and
as
a
more
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
of
our
plant
would
be
advantageous
on
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
,
individuals
with
this
tendency
more
and
more
increased
,
would
be
continually
favoured
or
selected
,
until
at
last
a
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
might
be
effected
.
It
would
take
up
too
much
space
to
show
the
various
steps
,
through
dimorphism
and
other
means
,
by
which
the
separation
of
the
sexes
in
plants
of
various
kinds
is
apparently
now
in
progress
;
but
I
may
add
that
some
of
the
species
of
holly
in
North
America
,
are
,
according
to
Asa
Gray
,
in
an
exactly
intermediate
condition
,
or
,
as
he
expresses
it
,
are
more
or
less
dioeciously
polygamous
.
Let
us
now
turn
to
the
nectar
feeding
insects
;
we
may
suppose
the
plant
,
of
which
we
have
been
slowly
increasing
the
nectar
by
continued
selection
,
to
be
a
common
plant
;
and
that
certain
insects
depended
in
main
part
on
its
nectar
for
food
.
I
could
give
many
facts
showing
how
anxious
bees
are
to
save
time
:
for
instance
,
their
habit
of
cutting
holes
and
sucking
the
nectar
at
the
bases
of
certain
flowers
,
which
,
with
a
very
little
more
trouble
,
they
can
enter
by
the
mouth
.
Bearing
such
facts
in
mind
,
it
may
be
believed
that
under
certain
circumstances
individual
differences
in
the
curvature
or
length
of
the
proboscis
,
&c
.
,
too
slight
to
be
appreciated
by
us
,
might
profit
a
bee
or
other
insect
,
so
that
certain
individuals
would
be
able
to
obtain
their
food
more
quickly
than
others
;
and
thus
the
communities
to
which
they
belonged
would
flourish
and
throw
off
many
swarms
inheriting
the
same
peculiarities
.
The
tubes
of
the
corolla
of
the
common
red
and
incarnate
clovers
(
Trifolium
pratense
and
incarnatum
)
do
not
on
a
hasty
glance
appear
to
differ
in
length
;
yet
the
hive
bee
can
easily
suck
the
nectar
out
of
the
incarnate
clover
,
but
not
out
of
the
common
red
clover
,
which
is
visited
by
humble
bees
alone
;
so
that
whole
fields
of
red
clover
offer
in
vain
an
abundant
supply
of
precious
nectar
to
the
hive
bee
.
That
this
nectar
is
much
liked
by
the
hive
bee
is
certain
;
for
I
have
repeatedly
seen
,
but
only
in
the
autumn
,
many
hive
bees
sucking
the
flowers
through
holes
bitten
in
the
base
of
the
tube
by
humble
bees
.
The
difference
in
the
length
of
the
corolla
in
the
two
kinds
of
clover
,
which
determines
the
visits
of
the
hive
bee
,
must
be
very
trifling
;
for
I
have
been
assured
that
when
red
clover
has
been
mown
,
the
flowers
of
the
second
crop
are
somewhat
smaller
,
and
that
these
are
visited
by
many
hive
bees
.
I
do
not
know
whether
this
statement
is
accurate
;
nor
whether
another
published
statement
can
be
trusted
,
namely
,
that
the
Ligurian
bee
which
is
generally
considered
a
mere
variety
of
the
common
hive
bee
,
and
which
freely
crosses
with
it
,
is
able
to
reach
and
suck
the
nectar
of
the
red
clover
.
Thus
,
in
a
country
where
this
kind
of
clover
abounded
,
it
might
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
hive
bee
to
have
a
slightly
longer
or
differently
constructed
proboscis
.
On
the
other
hand
,
as
the
fertility
of
this
clover
absolutely
depends
on
bees
visiting
the
flowers
,
if
humble
bees
were
to
become
rare
in
any
country
,
it
might
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
plant
to
have
a
,
shorter
or
more
deeply
divided
corolla
,
so
that
the
hive
bees
should
be
enabled
to
suck
its
flowers
.
Thus
I
can
understand
how
a
flower
and
a
bee
might
slowly
become
,
either
simultaneously
or
one
after
the
other
,
modified
and
adapted
to
each
other
in
the
most
perfect
manner
,
by
the
continued
preservation
of
all
the
individuals
which
presented
slight
deviations
of
structure
mutually
favourable
to
each
other
.
I
am
well
aware
that
this
doctrine
of
natural
selection
,
exemplified
in
the
above
imaginary
instances
,
is
open
to
the
same
objections
which
were
first
urged
against
Sir
Charles
Lyell's
noble
views
on
"
the
modern
changes
of
the
earth
,
as
illustrative
of
geology
"
;
but
we
now
seldom
hear
the
agencies
which
we
see
still
at
work
,
spoken
of
as
trifling
or
insignificant
,
when
used
in
explaining
the
excavation
of
the
deepest
valleys
or
the
formation
of
long
lines
of
inland
cliffs
.
Natural
selection
acts
only
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
small
inherited
modifications
,
each
profitable
to
the
preserved
being
;
and
as
modern
geology
has
almost
banished
such
views
as
the
excavation
of
a
great
valley
by
a
single
diluvial
wave
,
so
will
natural
selection
banish
the
belief
of
the
continued
creation
of
new
organic
beings
,
or
of
any
great
and
sudden
modification
in
their
structure
.
On
the
Intercrossing
of
Individuals
I
must
here
introduce
a
short
digression
.
In
the
case
of
animals
and
plants
with
separated
sexes
,
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
two
individuals
must
always
(
with
the
exception
of
the
curious
and
not
well
understood
cases
of
parthenogenesis
)
unite
for
each
birth
;
but
in
the
case
of
hermaphrodites
this
is
far
from
obvious
.
Nevertheless
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
with
all
hermaphrodites
two
individuals
,
either
occasionally
or
habitually
,
concur
for
the
reproduction
of
their
kind
.
This
view
was
long
ago
doubtfully
suggested
by
Sprengel
,
Knight
and
Kolreuter
.
We
shall
presently
see
its
importance
;
but
I
must
here
treat
the
subject
with
extreme
brevity
,
though
I
have
the
materials
prepared
for
an
ample
discussion
.
All
vertebrate
animals
,
all
insects
,
and
some
other
large
groups
of
animals
,
pair
for
each
birth
.
Modern
research
has
much
diminished
the
number
of
supposed
hermaphrodites
,
and
of
real
hermaphrodites
a
large
number
pair
;
that
is
,
two
individuals
regularly
unite
for
reproduction
,
which
is
all
that
concerns
us
.
But
still
there
are
many
hermaphrodite
animals
which
certainly
do
not
habitually
pair
,
and
a
vast
majority
of
plants
are
hermaphrodites
.
What
reason
,
it
may
be
asked
,
is
there
for
supposing
in
these
cases
that
two
individuals
ever
concur
in
reproduction
?
As
it
is
impossible
here
to
enter
on
details
,
I
must
trust
to
some
general
considerations
alone
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
have
collected
so
large
a
body
of
facts
,
and
made
so
many
experiments
,
showing
,
in
accordance
with
the
almost
universal
belief
of
breeders
,
that
with
animals
and
plants
a
cross
between
different
varieties
,
or
between
individuals
of
the
same
variety
but
of
another
strain
,
gives
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
that
close
interbreeding
diminishes
vigour
and
fertility
;
that
these
facts
alone
incline
me
to
believe
that
it
is
a
general
law
of
nature
that
no
organic
being
fertilises
itself
for
a
perpetuity
of
generations
;
but
that
a
cross
with
another
individual
is
occasionally
perhaps
at
long
intervals
of
time
indispensable
.
On
the
belief
that
this
is
a
law
of
nature
,
we
can
,
I
think
,
understand
several
large
classes
of
facts
,
such
as
the
following
,
which
on
any
other
view
are
inexplicable
.
Every
hybridizer
knows
how
unfavourable
exposure
to
wet
is
to
the
fertilisation
of
a
flower
,
yet
what
a
multitude
of
flowers
have
their
anthers
and
stigmas
fully
exposed
to
the
weather!
If
an
occasional
cross
be
indispensable
,
notwithstanding
that
the
plant's
own
anthers
and
pistil
stand
so
near
each
other
as
almost
to
insure
self
fertilisation
,
the
fullest
freedom
for
the
entrance
of
pollen
from
another
individual
will
explain
the
above
state
of
exposure
of
the
organs
.
Many
flowers
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
their
organs
of
fructification
closely
enclosed
,
as
in
the
great
papilionaceous
or
pea
family
;
but
these
almost
invariably
present
beautiful
and
curious
adaptations
in
relation
to
the
visits
of
insects
.
So
necessary
are
the
visits
of
bees
to
many
papilionaceous
flowers
,
that
their
fertility
is
greatly
diminished
if
these
visits
be
prevented
.
Now
,
it
is
scarcely
possible
for
insects
to
fly
from
flower
and
flower
,
and
not
to
carry
pollen
from
one
to
the
other
,
to
the
great
good
of
the
plant
.
Insects
act
like
a
camel
hair
pencil
,
and
it
is
sufficient
to
ensure
fertilisation
,
just
to
touch
with
the
same
brush
the
anthers
of
one
flower
and
then
the
stigma
of
another
;
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
bees
would
thus
produce
a
multitude
of
hybrids
between
distinct
species
;
for
if
a
plant's
own
pollen
and
that
from
another
species
are
placed
on
the
same
stigma
,
the
former
is
so
prepotent
that
it
invariably
and
completely
destroys
,
as
has
been
shown
by
Gartner
,
the
influence
of
the
foreign
pollen
.
When
the
stamens
of
a
flower
suddenly
spring
towards
the
pistil
,
or
slowly
move
one
after
the
other
towards
it
,
the
contrivance
seems
adapted
solely
to
ensure
self
fertilisation
;
and
no
doubt
it
is
useful
for
this
end
:
but
the
agency
of
insects
is
often
required
to
cause
the
stamens
to
spring
forward
,
as
Kolreuter
has
shown
to
be
the
case
with
the
barberry
;
and
in
this
very
genus
,
which
seems
to
have
a
special
contrivance
for
self
fertilisation
,
it
is
well
known
that
,
if
closely
allied
forms
or
varieties
are
planted
near
each
other
,
it
is
hardly
possible
to
raise
pure
seedlings
,
so
largely
do
they
naturally
cross
.
In
numerous
other
cases
,
far
from
self
fertilisation
being
favoured
,
there
are
special
contrivances
which
effectually
prevent
the
stigma
receiving
pollen
from
its
own
flower
,
as
I
could
show
from
the
works
of
Sprengel
and
others
,
as
well
as
from
my
own
observations
:
for
instance
,
in
Lobelia
fulgens
,
there
is
a
really
beautiful
and
elaborate
contrivance
by
which
all
the
infinitely
numerous
pollen
granules
are
swept
out
of
the
conjoined
anthers
of
each
flower
,
before
the
stigma
of
that
individual
flower
is
ready
to
receive
them
;
and
as
this
flower
is
never
visited
,
at
least
in
my
garden
,
by
insects
,
it
never
sets
a
seed
,
though
by
placing
pollen
from
one
flower
on
the
stigma
of
another
,
I
raise
plenty
of
seedlings
.
Another
species
of
Lobelia
which
is
visited
by
bees
,
seeds
freely
in
my
garden
.
In
very
many
other
cases
,
though
there
is
no
special
mechanical
contrivance
to
prevent
the
stigma
receiving
pollen
from
the
same
flower
,
yet
,
as
Sprengel
,
and
more
recently
Hildebrand
,
and
others
,
have
shown
,
and
as
I
can
confirm
,
either
the
anthers
burst
before
the
stigma
is
ready
for
fertilisation
,
or
the
stigma
is
ready
before
the
pollen
of
that
flower
is
ready
,
so
that
these
so
named
dichogamous
plants
have
in
fact
separated
sexes
,
and
must
habitually
be
crossed
.
So
it
is
with
the
reciprocally
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
previously
alluded
to
.
How
strange
are
these
facts!
How
strange
that
the
pollen
and
stigmatic
surface
of
the
same
flower
,
though
placed
so
close
together
,
as
if
for
the
very
purpose
of
self
fertilisation
,
should
be
in
so
many
cases
mutually
useless
to
each
other!
How
simply
are
these
facts
explained
on
the
view
of
an
occasional
cross
with
a
distinct
individual
being
advantageous
or
indispensable!
If
several
varieties
of
the
cabbage
,
radish
,
onion
,
and
of
some
other
plants
,
be
allowed
to
seed
near
each
other
,
a
large
majority
of
the
seedlings
thus
raised
turn
out
,
as
I
have
found
,
mongrels
:
for
instance
,
I
raised
233
seedling
cabbages
from
some
plants
of
different
varieties
growing
near
each
other
,
and
of
these
only
78
were
true
to
their
kind
,
and
some
even
of
these
were
not
perfectly
true
.
Yet
the
pistil
of
each
cabbage
flower
is
surrounded
not
only
by
its
own
six
stamens
but
by
those
of
the
many
other
flowers
on
the
same
plant
;
and
the
pollen
of
each
flower
readily
gets
on
its
own
stigma
without
insect
agency
;
for
I
have
found
that
plants
carefully
protected
from
insects
produce
the
full
number
of
pods
.
How
,
then
,
comes
it
that
such
a
vast
number
of
the
seedlings
are
mongrelized
?
It
must
arise
from
the
pollen
of
a
distinct
variety
having
a
prepotent
effect
over
the
flower's
own
pollen
;
and
that
this
is
part
of
the
general
law
of
good
being
derived
from
the
intercrossing
of
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
.
When
distinct
species
are
crossed
the
case
is
reversed
,
for
a
plant's
own
pollen
is
almost
always
prepotent
over
foreign
pollen
;
but
to
this
subject
we
shall
return
in
a
future
chapter
.
In
the
case
of
a
large
tree
covered
with
innumerable
flowers
,
it
may
be
objected
that
pollen
could
seldom
be
carried
from
tree
to
tree
,
and
at
most
only
from
flower
to
flower
on
the
same
tree
;
and
flowers
on
the
same
tree
can
be
considered
as
distinct
individuals
only
in
a
limited
sense
.
I
believe
this
objection
to
be
valid
,
but
that
nature
has
largely
provided
against
it
by
giving
to
trees
a
strong
tendency
to
bear
flowers
with
separated
sexes
.
When
the
sexes
are
separated
,
although
the
male
and
female
flowers
may
be
produced
on
the
same
tree
,
pollen
must
be
regularly
carried
from
flower
to
flower
;
and
this
will
give
a
better
chance
of
pollen
being
occasionally
carried
from
tree
to
tree
.
That
trees
belonging
to
all
Orders
have
their
sexes
more
often
separated
than
other
plants
,
I
find
to
be
the
case
in
this
country
;
and
at
my
request
Dr
.
Hooker
tabulated
the
trees
of
New
Zealand
,
and
Dr
.
Asa
Gray
those
of
the
United
States
,
and
the
result
was
as
I
anticipated
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Dr
.
Hooker
informs
me
that
the
rule
does
not
hold
good
in
Australia
but
if
most
of
the
Australian
trees
are
dichogamous
,
the
same
result
would
follow
as
if
they
bore
flowers
with
separated
sexes
.
I
have
made
these
few
remarks
on
trees
simply
to
call
attention
to
the
subject
.
Turning
for
a
brief
space
to
animals
:
various
terrestrial
species
are
hermaphrodites
,
such
as
the
land
mollusca
and
earth
worms
;
but
these
all
pair
.
As
yet
I
have
not
found
a
single
terrestrial
animal
which
can
fertilise
itself
.
This
remarkable
fact
,
which
offers
so
strong
a
contrast
with
terrestrial
plants
,
is
intelligible
on
the
view
of
an
occasional
cross
being
indispensable
;
for
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
fertilising
element
there
are
no
means
,
analogous
to
the
action
of
insects
and
of
the
wind
with
plants
,
by
which
an
occasional
cross
could
be
effected
with
terrestrial
animals
without
the
concurrence
of
two
individuals
.
Of
aquatic
animals
,
there
are
many
self
fertilizing
hermaphrodites
;
but
here
the
currents
of
water
offer
an
obvious
means
for
an
occasional
cross
.
As
in
the
case
of
flowers
,
I
have
as
yet
failed
,
after
consultation
with
one
of
the
highest
authorities
,
namely
,
Professor
Huxley
,
to
discover
a
single
hermaphrodite
animal
with
the
organs
of
reproduction
so
perfectly
enclosed
that
access
from
without
,
and
the
occasional
influence
of
a
distinct
individual
,
can
be
shown
to
be
physically
impossible
.
Cirripedes
long
appeared
to
me
to
present
,
under
this
point
of
view
,
a
case
of
great
difficulty
;
but
I
have
been
enabled
,
by
a
fortunate
chance
,
to
prove
that
two
individuals
,
though
both
are
self
fertilising
hermaphrodites
,
do
sometimes
cross
.
It
must
have
struck
most
naturalists
as
a
strange
anomaly
that
,
both
with
animals
and
plants
,
some
species
of
the
same
family
and
even
of
the
same
genus
,
though
agreeing
closely
with
each
other
in
their
whole
organisation
,
are
hermaphrodites
,
and
some
unisexual
.
But
if
,
in
fact
,
all
hermaphrodites
do
occasionally
intercross
,
the
difference
between
them
and
unisexual
species
is
,
as
far
as
function
is
concerned
,
very
small
.
From
these
several
considerations
and
from
the
many
special
facts
which
I
have
collected
,
but
which
I
am
unable
here
to
give
,
it
appears
that
with
animals
and
plants
an
occasional
intercross
between
distinct
individuals
is
a
very
general
,
if
not
universal
,
law
of
nature
.
Circumstances
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
forms
through
Natural
Selection
This
is
an
extremely
intricate
subject
.
A
great
amount
of
variability
,
under
which
term
individual
differences
are
always
included
,
will
evidently
be
favourable
.
A
large
number
of
individuals
,
by
giving
a
better
chance
within
any
given
period
for
the
appearance
of
profitable
variations
,
will
compensate
for
a
lesser
amount
of
variability
in
each
individual
,
and
is
,
I
believe
,
a
highly
important
element
of
success
.
Though
Nature
grants
long
periods
of
time
for
the
work
of
natural
selection
,
she
does
not
grant
an
indefinite
period
;
for
as
all
organic
beings
are
striving
to
seize
on
each
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
if
any
one
species
does
not
become
modified
and
improved
in
a
corresponding
degree
with
its
competitors
,
it
will
be
exterminated
.
Unless
favourable
variations
be
inherited
by
some
at
least
of
the
offspring
,
nothing
can
be
effected
by
natural
selection
.
The
tendency
to
reversion
may
often
check
or
prevent
the
work
;
but
as
this
tendency
has
not
prevented
man
from
forming
by
selection
numerous
domestic
races
,
why
should
it
prevail
against
natural
selection
?
In
the
case
of
methodical
selection
,
a
breeder
selects
for
some
definite
object
,
and
if
the
individuals
be
allowed
freely
to
intercross
,
his
work
will
completely
fail
.
But
when
many
men
,
without
intending
to
alter
the
breed
,
have
a
nearly
common
standard
of
perfection
,
and
all
try
to
procure
and
breed
from
the
best
animals
,
improvement
surely
but
slowly
follows
from
this
unconscious
process
of
selection
,
notwithstanding
that
there
is
no
separation
of
selected
individuals
.
Thus
it
will
be
under
nature
;
for
within
a
confined
area
,
with
some
place
in
the
natural
polity
not
perfectly
occupied
,
all
the
individuals
varying
in
the
right
direction
,
though
in
different
degrees
,
will
tend
to
be
preserved
.
But
if
the
area
be
large
,
its
several
districts
will
almost
certainly
present
different
conditions
of
life
;
and
then
,
if
the
same
species
undergoes
modification
in
different
districts
,
the
newly
formed
varieties
will
intercross
on
the
confines
of
each
.
But
we
shall
see
in
the
sixth
chapter
that
intermediate
varieties
,
inhabiting
intermediate
districts
,
will
in
the
long
run
generally
be
supplanted
by
one
of
the
adjoining
varieties
.
Intercrossing
will
chiefly
affect
those
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
and
wander
much
,
and
which
do
not
breed
at
a
very
quick
rate
.
Hence
with
animals
of
this
nature
,
for
instance
,
birds
,
varieties
will
generally
be
confined
to
separated
countries
;
and
this
I
find
to
be
the
case
.
With
hermaphrodite
organisms
which
cross
only
occasionally
,
and
likewise
with
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
,
but
which
wander
little
and
can
increase
at
a
rapid
rate
,
a
new
and
improved
variety
might
be
quickly
formed
on
any
one
spot
,
and
might
there
maintain
itself
in
a
body
and
afterwards
spread
,
so
that
the
individuals
of
the
new
variety
would
chiefly
cross
together
.
On
this
principle
,
nurserymen
always
prefer
saving
seed
from
a
large
body
of
plants
,
as
the
chance
of
intercrossing
is
thus
lessened
.
Even
with
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
,
and
which
do
not
propagate
rapidly
,
we
must
not
assume
that
free
intercrossing
would
always
eliminate
the
effects
of
natural
selection
;
for
I
can
bring
forward
a
considerable
body
of
facts
showing
that
within
the
same
area
,
two
varieties
of
the
same
animal
may
long
remain
distinct
,
from
haunting
different
stations
,
from
breeding
at
slightly
different
seasons
,
or
from
the
individuals
of
each
variety
preferring
to
pair
together
.
Intercrossing
plays
a
very
important
part
in
nature
by
keeping
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
or
of
the
same
variety
,
true
and
uniform
in
character
.
It
will
obviously
thus
act
far
more
efficiently
with
those
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
;
but
,
as
already
stated
,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
occasional
intercrosses
take
place
with
all
animals
and
plants
.
Even
if
these
take
place
only
at
long
intervals
of
time
,
the
young
thus
produced
will
gain
so
much
in
vigour
and
fertility
over
the
offspring
from
long
continued
self
fertilisation
,
that
they
will
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
and
propagating
their
kind
;
and
thus
in
the
long
run
the
influence
of
crosses
,
even
at
rare
intervals
,
will
be
great
.
With
respect
to
organic
beings
extremely
low
in
the
scale
,
which
do
not
propagate
sexually
,
nor
conjugate
,
and
which
cannot
possibly
intercross
,
uniformity
of
character
can
be
retained
by
them
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
,
only
through
the
principle
of
inheritance
,
and
through
natural
selection
which
will
destroy
any
individuals
departing
from
the
proper
type
.
If
the
conditions
of
life
change
and
the
form
undergoes
modification
,
uniformity
of
character
can
be
given
to
the
modified
offspring
,
solely
by
natural
selection
preserving
similar
favourable
variations
.
Isolation
,
also
,
is
an
important
element
in
the
modification
of
species
through
natural
selection
.
In
a
confined
or
isolated
area
,
if
not
very
large
,
the
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
will
generally
be
almost
uniform
;
so
that
natural
selection
will
tend
to
modify
all
the
varying
individuals
of
the
same
species
in
the
same
manner
.
Intercrossing
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
districts
will
,
also
,
be
thus
prevented
.
Moritz
Wagner
has
lately
published
an
interesting
essay
on
this
subject
,
and
has
shown
that
the
service
rendered
by
isolation
in
preventing
crosses
between
newly
formed
varieties
is
probably
greater
even
than
I
supposed
.
But
from
reasons
already
assigned
I
can
by
no
means
agree
with
this
naturalist
,
that
migration
and
isolation
are
necessary
elements
for
the
formation
of
new
species
.
The
importance
of
isolation
is
likewise
great
in
preventing
,
after
any
physical
change
in
the
conditions
,
such
as
of
climate
,
elevation
of
the
land
,
&c
.
,
the
immigration
of
better
adapted
organisms
;
and
thus
new
places
in
the
natural
economy
of
the
district
will
be
left
open
to
be
filled
up
by
the
modification
of
the
old
inhabitants
.
Lastly
,
isolation
will
give
time
for
a
new
variety
to
be
improved
at
a
slow
rate
;
and
this
may
sometimes
be
of
much
importance
.
If
,
however
,
an
isolated
area
be
very
small
,
either
from
being
surrounded
by
barriers
,
or
from
having
very
peculiar
physical
conditions
,
the
total
number
of
the
inhabitants
will
be
small
;
and
this
will
retard
the
production
of
new
species
through
natural
selection
,
by
decreasing
the
chances
of
favourable
variations
arising
.
The
mere
lapse
of
time
by
itself
does
nothing
,
either
for
or
against
natural
selection
.
I
state
this
because
it
has
been
erroneously
asserted
that
the
element
of
time
has
been
assumed
by
me
to
play
an
all
important
part
in
modifying
species
,
as
if
all
the
forms
of
life
were
necessarily
undergoing
change
through
some
innate
law
.
Lapse
of
time
is
only
so
far
important
,
and
its
importance
in
this
respect
is
great
,
that
it
gives
a
better
chance
of
beneficial
variations
arising
and
of
their
being
selected
,
accumulated
,
and
fixed
.
It
likewise
tends
to
increase
the
direct
action
of
the
physical
conditions
of
life
,
in
relation
to
the
constitution
of
each
organism
.
If
we
turn
to
nature
to
test
the
truth
of
these
remarks
,
and
look
at
any
small
isolated
area
,
such
as
an
oceanic
island
,
although
the
number
of
species
inhabiting
it
is
small
,
as
we
shall
see
in
our
chapter
on
Geographical
Distribution
;
yet
of
these
species
a
very
large
proportion
are
endemic
,
that
is
,
have
been
produced
there
and
nowhere
else
in
the
world
.
Hence
an
oceanic
island
at
first
sight
seems
to
have
been
highly
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
species
.
But
we
may
thus
deceive
ourselves
,
for
to
ascertain
whether
small
isolated
area
,
or
a
large
open
area
like
a
continent
has
been
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
organic
forms
,
we
ought
to
make
the
comparison
within
equal
times
;
and
this
we
are
incapable
of
doing
.
Although
isolation
is
of
great
importance
in
the
production
of
new
species
,
on
the
whole
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
largeness
of
area
is
still
more
important
,
especially
for
the
production
of
species
which
shall
prove
capable
of
enduring
for
a
long
period
,
and
of
spreading
widely
.
Throughout
a
great
and
open
area
,
not
only
will
there
be
a
better
chance
of
favourable
variations
,
arising
from
the
large
number
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
there
supported
,
but
the
conditions
of
life
are
much
more
complex
from
the
large
number
of
already
existing
species
;
and
if
some
of
these
many
species
become
modified
and
improved
,
others
will
have
to
be
improved
in
a
corresponding
degree
,
or
they
will
be
exterminated
.
Each
new
form
,
also
,
as
soon
as
it
has
been
much
improved
,
will
be
able
to
spread
over
the
open
and
continuous
area
,
and
will
thus
come
into
competition
with
many
other
forms
.
Moreover
,
great
areas
,
though
now
continuous
,
will
often
,
owing
to
former
oscillations
of
level
,
have
existed
in
a
broken
condition
;
so
that
the
good
effects
of
isolation
will
generally
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
have
concurred
.
Finally
,
I
conclude
that
,
although
small
isolated
areas
have
been
in
some
respects
highly
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
species
,
yet
that
the
course
of
modification
will
generally
have
been
more
rapid
on
large
areas
;
and
what
is
more
important
,
that
the
new
forms
produced
on
large
areas
,
which
already
have
been
victorious
over
many
competitors
,
will
be
those
that
will
spread
most
widely
,
and
will
give
rise
to
the
greatest
number
of
new
varieties
and
species
.
They
will
thus
play
a
more
important
part
in
the
changing
history
of
the
organic
world
.
In
accordance
with
this
view
,
we
can
,
perhaps
,
understand
some
facts
which
will
be
again
alluded
to
in
our
chapter
on
Geographical
Distribution
;
for
instance
,
the
fact
of
the
productions
of
the
smaller
continent
of
Australia
now
yielding
before
those
of
the
larger
Europaeo
Asiatic
area
.
Thus
,
also
,
it
is
that
continental
productions
have
everywhere
become
so
largely
naturalised
on
islands
.
On
a
small
island
,
the
race
for
life
will
have
been
less
severe
,
and
there
will
have
been
less
modification
and
less
extermination
.
Hence
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
the
flora
of
Madeira
,
according
to
Oswald
Heer
,
resembles
to
a
certain
extent
the
extinct
tertiary
flora
of
Europe
.
All
fresh
water
basins
,
taken
together
,
make
a
small
area
compared
with
that
of
the
sea
or
of
the
land
.
Consequently
,
the
competition
between
fresh
water
productions
will
have
been
less
severe
than
elsewhere
;
new
forms
will
have
been
then
more
slowly
produced
,
and
old
forms
more
slowly
exterminated
.
And
it
is
in
fresh
water
basins
that
we
find
seven
genera
of
Ganoid
fishes
,
remnants
of
a
once
preponderant
order
:
and
in
fresh
water
we
find
some
of
the
most
anomalous
forms
now
known
in
the
world
as
the
Ornithorhynchus
and
Lepidosiren
which
,
like
fossils
,
connect
to
a
certain
extent
orders
at
present
widely
sundered
in
the
natural
scale
.
These
anomalous
forms
may
be
called
living
fossils
;
they
have
endured
to
the
present
day
,
from
having
inhabited
a
confined
area
,
and
from
having
been
exposed
to
less
varied
,
and
therefore
less
severe
,
competition
.
To
sum
up
,
as
far
as
the
extreme
intricacy
of
the
subject
permits
,
the
circumstances
favourable
and
unfavourable
for
the
reduction
of
new
species
through
natural
selection
.
I
conclude
that
for
terrestrial
productions
a
large
continental
area
,
which
has
undergone
many
oscillations
of
level
,
will
have
been
the
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
many
new
forms
of
life
,
fitted
to
endure
for
a
long
time
and
to
spread
widely
.
Whilst
the
area
existed
as
a
continent
,
the
inhabitants
will
have
been
numerous
in
individuals
and
kinds
,
and
will
have
been
subjected
to
severe
competition
.
When
converted
by
subsidence
into
large
separate
islands
,
there
will
still
have
existed
many
individuals
of
the
same
species
on
each
island
:
intercrossing
on
the
confines
of
the
range
of
each
new
species
will
have
been
checked
:
after
physical
changes
of
any
kind
,
immigration
will
have
been
prevented
,
so
that
new
places
in
the
polity
of
each
island
will
have
had
to
be
filled
up
by
the
modification
of
the
old
inhabitants
;
and
time
will
have
been
allowed
for
the
varieties
in
each
to
become
well
modified
and
perfected
.
When
,
by
renewed
elevation
,
the
islands
were
reconverted
into
a
continental
area
,
there
will
again
have
been
very
severe
competition
:
the
most
favoured
or
improved
varieties
will
have
been
enabled
to
spread
:
there
will
have
been
much
extinction
of
the
less
improved
forms
,
and
the
relative
proportional
numbers
of
the
various
inhabitants
of
the
reunited
continent
will
again
have
been
changed
;
and
again
there
will
have
been
a
fair
field
for
natural
selection
to
improve
still
further
the
inhabitants
,
and
thus
to
produce
new
species
.
That
natural
selection
generally
acts
with
extreme
slowness
I
fully
admit
.
It
can
act
only
when
there
are
places
in
the
natural
polity
of
a
district
which
can
be
better
occupied
by
the
modification
of
some
of
its
existing
inhabitants
.
The
occurrence
of
such
places
will
often
depend
on
physical
changes
,
which
generally
take
place
very
slowly
,
and
on
the
immigration
of
better
adapted
forms
being
prevented
.
As
some
few
of
the
old
inhabitants
become
modified
,
the
mutual
relations
of
others
will
often
be
disturbed
;
and
this
will
create
new
places
,
ready
to
be
filled
up
by
better
adapted
forms
,
but
all
this
will
take
place
very
slowly
.
Although
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
differ
in
some
slight
degree
from
each
other
,
it
would
often
be
long
before
differences
of
the
right
nature
in
various
parts
of
the
organisation
might
occur
.
The
result
would
often
be
greatly
retarded
by
free
intercrossing
.
Many
will
exclaim
that
these
several
causes
are
amply
sufficient
to
neutralise
the
power
of
natural
selection
.
I
do
not
believe
so
.
But
I
do
believe
that
natural
selection
will
generally
act
very
slowly
,
only
at
long
intervals
of
time
,
and
only
on
a
few
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
region
.
I
further
believe
that
these
slow
,
intermittent
results
accord
well
with
what
geology
tells
us
of
the
rate
and
manner
at
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
have
changed
.
Slow
though
the
process
of
selection
may
be
,
if
feeble
man
can
do
much
by
artificial
selection
,
I
can
see
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
change
,
to
the
beauty
and
complexity
of
the
coadaptations
between
all
organic
beings
,
one
with
another
and
with
their
physical
conditions
of
life
,
which
may
have
been
effected
in
the
long
course
of
time
through
nature's
power
of
selection
,
that
is
by
the
survival
of
the
fittest
.
Extinction
caused
by
Natural
Selection
This
subject
will
he
more
fully
discussed
in
our
chapter
on
Geology
;
but
it
must
here
be
alluded
to
from
being
intimately
connected
with
natural
selection
.
Natural
selection
acts
solely
through
the
preservation
of
variations
in
some
way
advantageous
,
which
consequently
endure
.
Owing
to
the
high
geometrical
rate
of
increase
of
all
organic
beings
,
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
;
and
it
follows
from
this
,
that
as
the
favoured
forms
increase
in
number
,
so
,
generally
,
will
the
less
favoured
decrease
and
become
rare
.
Rarity
,
as
geology
tells
us
,
is
the
precursor
to
extinction
.
We
can
see
that
any
form
which
is
represented
by
few
individuals
will
run
a
good
chance
of
utter
extinction
,
during
great
fluctuations
in
the
nature
of
the
seasons
,
or
from
a
temporary
increase
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
.
But
we
may
go
further
than
this
;
for
,
as
new
forms
are
produced
,
unless
we
admit
that
specific
forms
can
go
on
indefinitely
increasing
in
number
,
many
old
forms
must
become
extinct
.
That
the
number
of
specific
forms
has
not
indefinitely
increased
,
geology
plainly
tells
us
;
and
we
shall
presently
attempt
to
show
why
it
is
that
the
number
of
species
throughout
the
world
has
not
become
immeasurably
great
.
We
have
seen
that
the
species
which
are
most
numerous
in
individuals
have
the
best
chance
of
producing
favourable
variations
within
any
given
period
.
We
have
evidence
of
this
,
in
the
facts
stated
in
the
second
chapter
showing
that
it
is
the
common
and
diffused
or
dominant
species
which
offer
the
greatest
number
of
recorded
varieties
.
Hence
,
rare
species
will
be
less
quickly
modified
or
improved
within
any
given
period
;
they
will
consequently
be
beaten
in
the
race
for
life
by
the
modified
and
improved
descendants
of
the
commoner
species
.
From
these
several
considerations
I
think
it
inevitably
follows
,
that
as
new
species
in
the
course
of
time
are
formed
through
natural
selection
,
others
will
become
rarer
and
rarer
,
and
finally
extinct
.
The
forms
which
stand
in
closest
competition
with
those
undergoing
modification
and
improvement
will
naturally
suffer
most
.
And
we
have
seen
in
the
chapter
on
the
Struggle
for
Existence
that
it
is
the
most
closely
allied
forms
,
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
and
species
of
the
same
genus
or
of
related
genera
,
which
,
from
having
nearly
the
same
structure
,
constitution
,
and
habits
,
generally
come
into
the
severest
competition
with
each
other
;
consequently
,
each
new
variety
or
species
,
during
the
progress
of
its
formation
,
will
generally
press
hardest
on
its
nearest
kindred
,
and
tend
to
exterminate
them
.
We
see
the
same
process
of
extermination
amongst
our
domesticated
productions
,
through
the
selection
of
improved
forms
by
man
.
Many
curious
instances
could
be
given
showing
how
quickly
new
breeds
of
cattle
,
sheep
,
and
other
animals
,
and
varieties
of
flowers
,
take
the
place
of
older
and
inferior
kinds
.
In
Yorkshire
,
it
is
historically
known
that
the
ancient
black
cattle
were
displaced
by
the
long
horns
,
and
that
these
"
were
swept
away
by
the
shorthorns
"
(
I
quote
the
words
of
an
agricultural
writer
)
"
as
if
by
some
murderous
pestilence
.
"
Divergence
of
Character
The
principle
,
which
I
have
designated
by
this
term
,
is
of
high
importance
,
and
explains
,
as
I
believe
,
several
important
facts
.
In
the
first
place
,
varieties
,
even
strongly
marked
ones
,
though
having
somewhat
of
the
character
of
species
as
is
shown
by
the
hopeless
doubts
in
many
cases
how
to
rank
them
yet
certainly
differ
far
less
from
each
other
than
do
good
and
distinct
species
.
Nevertheless
,
according
to
my
view
,
varieties
are
species
in
the
process
of
formation
,
or
are
,
as
I
have
called
them
,
incipient
species
.
How
,
then
,
does
the
lesser
difference
between
varieties
become
augmented
into
the
greater
difference
between
species
?
That
this
does
habitually
happen
,
we
must
infer
from
most
of
the
innumerable
species
throughout
nature
presenting
well
marked
differences
;
whereas
varieties
,
the
supposed
prototypes
and
parents
of
future
well
marked
species
,
present
slight
and
ill
defined
differences
.
Mere
chance
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
might
cause
one
variety
to
differ
in
some
character
from
its
parents
,
and
the
offspring
of
this
variety
again
to
differ
from
its
parent
in
the
very
same
character
and
in
a
greater
degree
;
but
this
alone
would
never
account
for
so
habitual
and
large
a
degree
of
difference
as
that
between
the
species
of
the
same
genus
.
As
has
always
been
my
practice
,
I
have
sought
light
on
this
head
from
our
domestic
productions
.
We
shall
here
find
something
analogous
.
It
will
be
admitted
that
the
production
of
races
so
different
as
short
horn
and
Hereford
cattle
,
race
and
cart
horses
,
the
several
breeds
of
pigeons
,
&c
.
,
could
never
have
been
effected
by
the
mere
chance
accumulation
of
similar
variations
during
many
successive
generations
.
In
practice
,
a
fancier
is
,
for
instance
,
struck
by
a
pigeon
having
a
slightly
shorter
beak
;
another
fancier
is
struck
by
a
pigeon
having
a
rather
longer
beak
;
and
on
the
acknowledged
principle
that
"
fanciers
do
not
and
will
not
admire
a
medium
standard
,
but
like
extremes
,
"
they
both
go
on
(
as
has
actually
occurred
with
the
sub
breeds
of
the
tumbler
pigeon
)
choosing
and
breeding
from
birds
with
longer
and
longer
beaks
,
or
with
shorter
and
shorter
beaks
.
Again
,
we
may
suppose
that
at
an
early
period
of
history
,
the
men
of
one
nation
or
district
required
swifter
horses
,
whilst
those
of
another
required
stronger
and
bulkier
horses
.
The
early
differences
would
be
very
slight
;
but
,
in
the
course
of
time
from
the
continued
selection
of
swifter
horses
in
the
one
case
,
and
of
stronger
ones
in
the
other
,
the
differences
would
become
greater
,
and
would
be
noted
as
forming
two
sub
breeds
.
Ultimately
,
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
,
these
sub
breeds
would
become
converted
into
two
well
established
and
distinct
breeds
.
As
the
differences
became
greater
,
the
inferior
animals
with
intermediate
characters
,
being
neither
swift
nor
very
strong
,
would
not
have
been
used
for
,
breeding
,
and
will
thus
have
tended
to
disappear
.
Here
,
then
,
we
see
in
man's
productions
the
action
of
what
may
be
called
the
principle
of
divergence
,
causing
differences
,
at
first
barely
appreciable
,
steadily
to
increase
,
and
the
breeds
to
diverge
in
character
,
both
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
.
But
how
,
it
may
be
asked
,
can
any
analogous
principle
apply
in
nature
?
I
believe
it
can
and
does
apply
most
efficiently
(
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
saw
how
)
,
from
the
simple
circumstance
that
the
more
diversified
the
descendants
from
any
one
species
become
in
structure
,
constitution
,
and
habits
,
by
so
much
will
they
be
better
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
widely
diversified
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
,
and
so
be
enabled
to
increase
in
numbers
.
We
can
clearly
discern
this
in
the
case
of
animals
with
simple
habits
.
Take
the
case
of
a
carnivorous
quadruped
,
of
which
the
number
that
can
be
supported
in
any
country
has
long
ago
arrived
at
its
full
average
.
If
its
natural
power
of
increase
be
allowed
to
act
,
it
can
succeed
in
increasing
(
the
country
not
undergoing
any
change
in
conditions
)
only
by
its
varying
descendants
seizing
on
places
at
present
occupied
by
other
animals
:
some
of
them
,
for
instance
,
being
enabled
to
feed
on
new
kinds
of
prey
,
either
dead
or
alive
;
some
inhabiting
new
stations
,
climbing
trees
,
frequenting
water
,
and
some
perhaps
becoming
less
carnivorous
.
The
more
diversified
in
habits
and
structure
the
descendants
of
our
carnivorous
animals
become
,
the
more
places
they
will
be
enabled
to
occupy
.
What
applies
to
one
animal
will
apply
throughout
all
time
to
all
animals
that
is
,
if
they
vary
for
otherwise
natural
selection
can
effect
nothing
.
So
it
will
be
with
plants
.
It
has
been
experimentally
proved
,
that
if
a
plot
of
ground
be
sown
with
one
species
of
grass
,
and
a
similar
plot
be
sown
with
several
distinct
genera
of
grasses
,
a
greater
number
of
plants
and
a
greater
weight
of
dry
herbage
can
be
raised
in
the
latter
than
in
the
former
case
.
The
same
has
been
found
to
hold
good
when
one
variety
and
several
mixed
varieties
of
wheat
have
been
sown
on
equal
spaces
of
ground
.
Hence
,
if
any
one
species
of
grass
were
to
go
on
varying
,
and
the
varieties
were
continually
selected
which
differed
from
each
other
in
the
same
manner
,
though
in
a
very
slight
degree
,
as
do
the
distinct
species
and
genera
of
grasses
,
a
greater
number
of
individual
plants
of
this
species
,
including
its
modified
descendants
,
would
succeed
in
living
on
the
same
piece
of
ground
.
And
we
know
that
each
species
and
each
variety
of
grass
is
annually
sowing
almost
countless
seeds
;
and
is
thus
striving
,
as
it
may
be
said
,
to
the
utmost
to
increase
in
number
.
Consequently
,
in
the
course
of
many
thousand
generations
,
the
most
distinct
varieties
of
any
one
species
of
grass
would
have
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
and
of
increasing
in
numbers
,
and
thus
of
supplanting
the
less
distinct
varieties
;
and
varieties
,
when
rendered
very
distinct
from
each
other
,
take
the
rank
of
species
.
The
truth
of
the
principle
that
the
greatest
amount
of
life
can
be
supported
by
great
diversification
of
structure
,
is
seen
under
many
natural
circumstances
.
In
an
extremely
small
area
,
especially
if
freely
open
to
immigration
,
and
where
the
contest
between
individual
and
individual
must
be
very
severe
,
we
always
find
great
diversity
in
its
inhabitants
.
For
instance
,
I
found
that
a
piece
of
turf
,
three
feet
by
four
in
size
,
which
had
been
exposed
for
many
years
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
,
supported
twenty
species
of
plants
,
and
these
belonged
to
eighteen
genera
and
to
eight
orders
,
which
shows
how
much
these
plants
differed
from
each
other
.
So
it
is
with
the
plants
and
insects
on
small
and
uniform
islets
:
also
in
small
ponds
of
fresh
water
.
Farmers
find
that
they
can
raise
most
food
by
a
rotation
of
plants
belonging
to
the
most
different
orders
:
nature
follows
what
may
be
called
a
simultaneous
rotation
.
Most
of
the
animals
and
plants
which
live
close
round
any
small
piece
of
ground
,
could
live
on
it
(
supposing
its
nature
not
to
be
in
any
way
peculiar
)
,
and
may
be
said
to
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to
live
there
;
but
,
it
is
seen
,
that
where
they
come
into
the
closest
competition
,
the
advantages
of
diversification
of
structure
,
with
the
accompanying
differences
of
habit
and
constitution
,
determine
that
the
inhabitants
,
which
thus
jostle
each
other
most
closely
,
shall
,
as
a
general
rule
,
belong
to
what
we
call
different
genera
and
orders
.
The
same
principle
is
seen
in
the
naturalisation
of
plants
through
man's
agency
in
foreign
lands
.
It
might
have
been
expected
that
the
plants
which
would
succeed
in
becoming
naturalised
in
any
land
would
generally
have
been
closely
allied
to
the
indigenes
;
for
these
are
commonly
looked
at
as
specially
created
and
adapted
for
their
own
country
.
It
might
also
,
perhaps
,
have
been
expected
that
naturalised
plants
would
have
belonged
to
a
few
groups
more
especially
adapted
to
certain
stations
in
their
new
homes
.
But
the
case
is
very
different
;
and
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
well
remarked
,
in
his
great
and
admirable
work
,
that
floras
gain
by
naturalisation
,
proportionally
with
the
number
of
the
native
genera
and
species
far
more
in
new
genera
than
in
new
species
.
To
give
a
single
instance
:
in
the
last
edition
of
Dr
.
Asa
Gray's
Manual
of
the
Flora
of
the
Northern
United
States
,
260
naturalized
plants
are
enumerated
,
and
these
belong
to
162
genera
.
We
thus
see
that
these
naturalised
plants
are
of
a
highly
diversified
nature
.
They
differ
,
moreover
,
to
a
large
extent
,
from
the
indigenes
,
for
out
of
the
162
naturalised
genera
,
no
less
than
100
genera
are
not
there
indigenous
,
and
thus
a
large
proportional
addition
is
made
to
the
genera
now
living
in
the
United
States
.
By
considering
the
nature
of
the
plants
or
animals
which
have
in
any
country
struggled
successfully
with
the
indigenes
and
have
there
become
naturalised
,
we
may
gain
some
crude
idea
in
what
manner
some
of
the
natives
would
have
to
be
modified
,
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
over
their
compatriots
;
and
we
may
at
least
infer
that
diversification
of
structure
,
amounting
to
new
generic
differences
,
would
be
profitable
to
them
.
The
advantage
of
diversification
of
structure
in
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
region
is
,
in
fact
,
the
same
as
that
of
the
physiological
division
of
labour
in
the
organs
of
the
same
individual
body
a
subject
so
well
elucidated
by
Milne
Edwards
.
No
physiologist
doubts
that
a
stomach
adapted
to
digest
vegetable
matter
alone
,
or
flesh
alone
,
draws
most
nutriment
from
these
substances
.
So
in
the
general
economy
of
any
land
,
the
more
widely
and
perfectly
the
animals
and
plants
are
diversified
for
different
habits
of
life
,
so
will
a
greater
number
of
individuals
be
capable
of
there
supporting
themselves
.
A
set
of
animals
,
with
their
organisation
but
little
diversified
,
could
hardly
compete
with
a
set
more
perfectly
diversified
in
structure
.
It
may
be
doubted
,
for
instance
,
whether
the
Australian
marsupials
,
which
are
divided
into
groups
differing
but
little
from
each
other
,
and
feebly
representing
,
as
Mr
.
Waterhouse
and
others
have
remarked
,
our
carnivorous
,
ruminant
,
and
rodent
mammals
,
could
successfully
compete
with
these
well
developed
orders
.
In
the
Australian
mammals
,
we
see
the
process
of
diversification
in
an
early
and
incomplete
stage
of
development
.
The
Probable
Effects
of
the
Action
of
Natural
Selection
through
Divergence
of
Character
and
Extinction
,
on
the
Descendants
of
a
Common
Ancestor
After
the
foregoing
discussion
,
which
has
been
much
compressed
,
we
may
assume
that
the
modified
descendants
of
any
one
species
will
succeed
so
much
the
better
as
they
become
more
diversified
in
structure
,
and
are
thus
enabled
to
encroach
on
places
occupied
by
other
beings
.
Now
let
us
see
how
this
principle
of
benefit
being
derived
from
divergence
of
character
,
combined
with
the
principles
of
natural
selection
and
of
extinction
,
tends
to
act
.
The
accompanying
diagram
(
See
diagram
)
will
aid
us
in
understanding
this
rather
perplexing
subject
.
Let
A
to
L
represent
the
species
of
a
genus
large
in
its
own
country
;
these
species
are
supposed
to
resemble
each
other
in
unequal
degrees
,
as
is
so
generally
the
case
in
nature
,
and
as
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
letters
standing
at
unequal
distances
.
I
have
said
a
large
genus
,
because
as
we
saw
in
the
second
chapter
,
on
an
average
more
species
vary
in
large
genera
than
in
small
genera
;
and
the
varying
species
of
the
large
genera
present
a
greater
number
of
varieties
.
We
have
,
also
,
seen
that
the
species
,
which
are
the
commonest
and
the
most
widely
diffused
,
vary
more
than
do
the
rare
and
restricted
species
.
Let
(
A
)
be
a
common
,
widely
diffused
,
and
varying
species
,
belonging
to
a
genus
large
in
its
own
country
.
The
branching
and
diverging
lines
of
unequal
lengths
proceeding
from
(
A
)
,
may
represent
its
varying
offspring
.
The
variations
are
supposed
to
be
extremely
slight
,
but
of
the
most
diversified
nature
;
they
are
not
supposed
all
to
appear
simultaneously
,
but
often
after
long
intervals
of
time
,
nor
are
they
an
supposed
to
endure
for
equal
periods
.
Only
those
variations
which
are
in
some
way
profitable
will
be
preserved
or
naturally
selected
.
And
here
the
importance
of
the
principle
of
benefit
derived
from
divergence
of
character
comes
in
;
for
this
will
generally
lead
to
the
most
different
or
divergent
variations
(
represented
by
the
outer
lines
)
being
preserved
and
accumulated
by
natural
selection
.
When
a
line
reaches
one
of
the
horizontal
lines
,
and
is
there
marked
by
a
small
numbered
letter
,
a
sufficient
amount
of
variation
is
supposed
to
have
been
accumulated
to
form
it
into
a
fairly
well
marked
variety
,
such
as
would
be
thought
worthy
of
record
in
a
systematic
work
.
The
intervals
between
the
horizontal
lines
in
the
diagram
,
may
represent
each
a
thousand
or
more
generations
.
After
a
thousand
generations
,
species
(
A
)
is
supposed
to
have
produced
two
fairly
well
marked
varieties
,
namely
a1
and
m1
.
These
two
varieties
will
generally
still
be
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
which
made
their
parents
variable
,
and
the
tendency
to
variability
is
in
itself
hereditary
;
consequently
they
will
likewise
tend
to
vary
,
and
commonly
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
did
their
parents
.
Moreover
,
these
two
varieties
,
being
only
slightly
modified
forms
,
will
tend
to
inherit
those
advantages
which
made
their
parent
(
A
)
more
numerous
than
most
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
same
country
;
they
will
also
partake
of
those
more
general
advantages
which
made
the
genus
to
which
the
parent
species
belonged
,
a
large
genus
in
its
own
country
.
And
all
these
circumstances
are
favourable
to
the
production
of
new
varieties
.
If
,
then
,
these
two
varieties
be
variable
,
the
most
divergent
of
their
variations
will
generally
be
preserved
during
the
next
thousand
generations
.
And
after
this
interval
,
variety
a1
is
supposed
in
the
diagram
to
have
produced
variety
a2
,
which
will
,
owing
to
the
principle
of
divergence
,
differ
more
from
(
A
)
than
did
variety
a1
.
Variety
m1
is
supposed
to
have
produced
two
varieties
,
namely
m2
and
s2
,
differing
from
each
other
,
and
more
considerably
from
their
common
parent
(
A
)
.
We
may
continue
the
process
by
similar
steps
for
any
length
of
time
;
some
of
the
varieties
,
after
each
thousand
generations
,
producing
only
a
single
variety
,
but
in
a
more
and
more
modified
condition
,
some
producing
two
or
three
varieties
,
and
some
failing
to
produce
any
.
Thus
the
varieties
or
modified
descendants
of
the
common
parent
(
A
)
,
will
generally
go
on
increasing
in
number
and
diverging
in
character
.
In
the
diagram
the
process
is
represented
up
to
the
ten
thousandth
generation
,
and
under
a
condensed
and
simplified
form
up
to
the
fourteen
thousandth
generation
.
But
I
must
here
remark
that
I
do
not
suppose
that
the
process
ever
goes
on
so
regularly
as
is
represented
in
the
diagram
,
though
in
itself
made
somewhat
irregular
,
nor
that
it
goes
on
continuously
;
it
is
far
more
probable
that
each
form
remains
for
long
periods
unaltered
,
and
then
again
undergoes
modification
.
Nor
do
I
suppose
that
the
most
divergent
varieties
are
invariably
preserved
:
a
medium
form
may
often
long
endure
,
and
may
or
may
not
produce
more
than
one
modified
descendant
;
for
natural
selection
will
always
act
according
to
the
nature
of
the
places
which
are
either
unoccupied
or
not
perfectly
occupied
by
other
beings
;
and
this
will
depend
on
infinitely
complex
relations
.
But
as
a
general
rule
,
the
more
diversified
in
structure
the
descendants
from
any
one
species
can
be
rendered
,
the
more
places
they
will
be
enabled
to
seize
on
,
and
the
more
their
modified
progeny
will
increase
.
In
our
diagram
the
line
of
succession
is
broken
at
regular
intervals
by
small
numbered
letters
marking
the
successive
forms
which
have
become
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
recorded
as
varieties
.
But
these
breaks
are
imaginary
,
and
might
have
been
inserted
anywhere
,
after
intervals
long
enough
to
allow
the
accumulation
of
a
considerable
amount
of
divergent
variation
.
As
all
the
modified
descendants
from
a
common
and
widely
diffused
species
,
belonging
to
a
large
genus
,
will
tend
to
partake
of
the
same
advantages
which
made
their
parent
successful
in
life
,
they
will
generally
go
on
multiplying
in
number
as
well
as
diverging
in
character
:
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
several
divergent
branches
proceeding
from
(
A
)
.
The
modified
offspring
from
the
later
and
more
highly
improved
branches
in
the
lines
of
descent
,
will
,
it
is
probable
,
often
take
the
place
of
,
and
so
destroy
,
the
earlier
and
less
improved
branches
:
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
some
of
the
lower
branches
not
reaching
to
the
upper
horizontal
lines
.
In
some
cases
no
doubt
the
process
of
modification
will
be
confined
to
a
single
line
of
descent
and
the
number
of
modified
descendants
will
not
be
increased
;
although
the
amount
of
divergent
modification
may
have
been
augmented
.
This
case
would
be
represented
in
the
diagram
,
if
all
the
lines
proceeding
from
(
A
)
were
removed
,
excepting
that
from
a1
to
a10
.
In
the
same
way
the
English
race
horse
and
English
pointer
have
apparently
both
gone
on
slowly
diverging
in
character
from
their
original
stocks
,
without
either
having
given
off
any
fresh
branches
or
races
.
After
ten
thousand
generations
,
species
(
A
)
is
supposed
to
have
produced
three
forms
,
a10
,
f10
,
and
m10
which
,
from
having
diverged
in
character
during
the
successive
generations
,
will
have
come
to
differ
largely
,
but
perhaps
unequally
,
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
.
If
we
suppose
the
amount
of
change
between
each
horizontal
line
in
our
diagram
to
be
excessively
small
,
these
three
forms
may
still
be
only
well
marked
varieties
;
but
we
have
only
to
suppose
the
steps
in
the
process
of
modification
to
be
more
numerous
or
greater
in
amount
,
to
convert
these
three
forms
into
well
defined
or
at
least
into
doubtful
species
.
Thus
the
diagram
illustrates
the
steps
by
which
the
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
are
increased
into
the
larger
differences
distinguishing
species
.
By
continuing
the
same
process
for
a
greater
number
of
generations
(
as
shown
in
the
diagram
in
a
condensed
and
simplified
manner
)
,
we
get
eight
species
,
marked
by
the
letters
between
a14
and
m14
,
all
descended
from
(
A
)
.
Thus
,
as
I
believe
,
species
are
multiplied
and
genera
are
formed
.
In
a
large
genus
it
is
probable
that
more
than
one
species
would
vary
.
In
the
diagram
I
have
assumed
that
a
second
species
(
I
)
has
produced
,
by
analogous
steps
,
after
ten
thousand
generations
,
either
two
well
marked
varieties
(
w10
and
z10
)
or
two
species
,
according
to
the
amount
of
change
supposed
to
be
represented
between
the
horizontal
lines
.
After
fourteen
thousand
generations
,
six
new
species
,
marked
by
the
letters
n14
to
z14
,
are
supposed
to
have
.
been
produced
.
In
any
genus
,
the
species
which
are
already
very
different
in
character
from
each
other
,
will
generally
tend
to
produce
the
greatest
number
of
modified
descendants
;
for
these
will
have
the
best
chance
of
seizing
on
new
and
widely
different
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
:
hence
in
the
diagram
I
have
chosen
the
extreme
species
(
A
)
,
and
the
nearly
extreme
species
(
I
)
,
as
those
which
have
largely
varied
,
and
have
given
rise
to
new
varieties
and
species
.
The
other
nine
species
(
marked
by
capital
letters
)
of
our
original
genus
,
may
for
long
but
unequal
periods
continue
to
transmit
unaltered
descendants
;
and
this
is
shown
in
the
diagram
by
the
dotted
lines
unequally
prolonged
upwards
.
But
during
the
process
of
modification
,
represented
in
the
diagram
,
another
of
our
principles
,
namely
that
of
extinction
,
will
have
played
an
important
part
.
As
in
each
fully
stocked
country
natural
selection
necessarily
acts
by
the
selected
form
having
some
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
over
other
forms
,
there
will
be
a
constant
tendency
in
the
improved
descendants
of
any
one
species
to
supplant
and
exterminate
in
each
stage
of
descent
their
predecessors
and
their
original
progenitor
.
For
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
between
those
forms
which
are
most
nearly
related
to
each
other
in
habits
,
constitution
,
and
structure
.
Hence
all
the
intermediate
forms
between
the
earlier
and
later
states
,
that
is
between
the
less
and
more
improved
states
of
the
same
species
,
as
well
as
the
original
parent
species
itself
,
will
generally
tend
to
become
extinct
.
So
it
probably
will
be
with
many
whole
collateral
lines
of
descent
,
which
will
be
conquered
by
later
and
improved
lines
.
If
,
however
,
the
modified
offspring
of
a
species
get
into
some
distinct
country
,
or
become
quickly
adapted
to
some
quite
new
station
,
in
which
offspring
and
progenitor
do
not
come
into
competition
,
both
may
continue
to
exist
.
If
,
then
,
our
diagram
be
assumed
to
represent
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
,
species
(
A
)
and
all
the
earlier
varieties
will
have
become
extinct
,
being
replaced
by
eight
new
species
(
a14
to
m14
)
;
and
species
(
I
)
will
be
replaced
by
six
(
n14
to
z14
)
new
species
.
But
we
may
go
further
than
this
.
The
original
species
of
our
genus
were
supposed
to
resemble
each
other
in
unequal
degrees
,
as
is
so
generally
the
case
in
nature
;
species
(
A
)
being
more
nearly
related
to
B
,
C
,
and
D
,
than
to
the
other
species
;
and
species
(
I
)
more
to
G
,
H
,
K
,
L
,
than
to
the
others
.
These
two
species
(
A
)
and
(
I
)
were
also
supposed
to
be
very
common
and
widely
diffused
species
,
so
that
they
must
originally
have
had
some
advantage
over
most
of
the
other
species
of
the
genus
.
Their
modified
descendants
,
fourteen
in
number
at
the
fourteen
thousandth
generation
will
probably
have
inherited
some
of
the
same
advantages
:
they
have
also
been
modified
and
improved
in
a
diversified
manner
at
each
stage
of
descent
,
so
as
to
have
become
adapted
to
many
related
places
in
the
natural
economy
of
their
country
.
It
seems
,
therefore
,
extremely
probable
that
they
will
have
taken
the
places
of
,
and
thus
exterminated
not
only
their
parents
(
A
)
and
(
I
)
,
but
likewise
some
of
the
original
species
which
were
most
nearly
related
to
their
parents
.
Hence
very
few
of
the
original
species
will
have
transmitted
offspring
to
the
fourteen
thousandth
generation
.
We
may
suppose
that
only
one
,
(
F
)
,
of
the
two
species
(
E
and
F
)
which
were
least
closely
related
to
the
other
nine
original
species
,
has
transmitted
descendants
to
this
late
stage
of
descent
.
The
new
species
in
our
diagram
descended
from
the
original
eleven
species
,
will
now
be
fifteen
in
number
.
Owing
to
the
divergent
tendency
of
natural
selection
,
the
extreme
amount
of
difference
in
character
between
species
a14
and
z14
will
be
much
greater
than
that
between
the
most
distinct
of
the
original
eleven
species
.
The
new
species
,
moreover
,
will
be
allied
to
each
other
in
a
widely
different
manner
.
Of
the
eight
descendants
from
(
A
)
the
three
marked
a14
,
q14
,
p14
,
will
be
nearly
related
from
having
recently
branched
off
from
a10
;
b14
,
and
f14
,
from
having
diverged
at
an
earlier
period
from
a1
,
will
be
in
some
degree
distinct
from
the
three
first
named
species
;
and
lastly
,
o14
,
e14
,
and
m14
,
will
be
nearly
related
one
to
the
other
,
but
,
from
having
diverged
at
the
first
commencement
of
the
process
of
modification
,
will
be
widely
different
from
the
other
five
species
,
and
may
constitute
a
sub
genus
or
a
distinct
genus
.
The
six
descendants
from
(
I
)
will
form
two
sub
genera
or
genera
.
But
as
the
original
species
(
I
)
differed
largely
from
(
A
)
,
standing
nearly
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
original
genus
,
the
six
descendants
from
(
I
)
will
,
owing
to
inheritance
alone
,
differ
considerably
from
the
eight
descendants
from
(
A
)
;
the
two
groups
,
moreover
,
are
supposed
to
have
gone
on
diverging
in
different
directions
.
The
intermediate
species
,
also
(
and
this
is
a
very
important
consideration
)
,
which
connected
the
original
species
(
A
)
and
(
I
)
,
have
all
become
,
excepting
(
F
)
,
extinct
,
and
have
left
no
descendants
.
Hence
the
six
new
species
descended
from
(
I
)
,
and
the
eight
descendants
from
(
A
)
,
will
have
to
be
ranked
as
very
distinct
genera
,
or
even
as
distinct
sub
families
.
Thus
it
is
,
as
I
believe
,
that
two
or
more
genera
are
produced
by
descent
with
modification
,
from
two
or
more
species
of
the
same
genus
.
And
the
two
or
more
parent
species
are
supposed
to
be
descended
from
some
one
species
of
an
earlier
genus
.
In
our
diagram
,
this
is
indicated
by
the
broken
lines
,
beneath
the
capital
letters
,
converging
in
sub
branches
downwards
towards
a
single
point
;
this
point
represents
a
species
,
the
supposed
progenitor
of
our
several
new
sub
genera
and
genera
.
It
is
worth
while
to
reflect
for
a
moment
on
the
character
of
the
new
species
F14
,
which
is
supposed
not
to
have
diverged
much
in
character
,
but
to
have
retained
the
form
of
(
F
)
,
either
unaltered
or
altered
only
in
a
slight
degree
.
In
this
case
,
its
affinities
to
the
other
fourteen
new
species
will
be
of
a
curious
and
circuitous
nature
.
Being
descended
from
a
form
which
stood
between
the
parent
species
(
A
)
and
(
I
)
,
now
supposed
to
be
extinct
and
unknown
,
it
will
be
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
the
two
groups
descended
from
these
two
species
.
But
as
these
two
groups
have
gone
on
diverging
in
character
from
the
type
of
their
parents
,
the
new
species
(
F14
)
will
not
be
directly
intermediate
between
them
,
but
rather
between
types
of
the
two
groups
;
and
every
naturalist
will
be
able
to
call
such
cases
before
his
mind
.
In
the
diagram
,
each
horizontal
line
has
hitherto
been
supposed
to
represent
a
thousand
generations
,
but
each
may
represent
a
million
or
more
generations
;
it
may
also
represent
a
section
of
the
successive
strata
of
the
earth's
crust
including
extinct
remains
.
We
shall
,
when
we
come
to
our
chapter
on
Geology
,
have
to
refer
again
to
this
subject
,
and
I
think
we
shall
then
see
that
the
diagram
throws
light
on
the
affinities
of
extinct
beings
,
which
,
though
generally
belonging
to
the
same
orders
,
families
,
or
genera
,
with
those
now
living
,
yet
are
often
,
in
some
degree
,
intermediate
in
character
between
existing
groups
;
and
we
can
understand
this
fact
,
for
the
extinct
species
lived
at
various
remote
epochs
when
the
branching
lines
of
descent
had
diverged
less
.
I
see
no
reason
to
limit
the
process
of
modification
,
as
now
explained
,
to
the
formation
of
genera
alone
.
If
,
in
the
diagram
,
we
suppose
the
amount
of
change
,
represented
by
each
successive
group
of
diverging
lines
to
be
great
,
the
forms
marked
a14
to
p14
,
those
marked
b14
and
f14
,
and
those
marked
o14
to
m14
,
will
form
three
very
distinct
genera
.
We
shall
also
have
two
very
distinct
genera
descended
from
(
I
)
,
differing
widely
from
the
descendants
of
(
A
)
.
These
two
groups
of
genera
will
thus
form
two
distinct
families
,
or
orders
,
according
to
the
amount
of
divergent
modification
supposed
to
be
represented
in
the
diagram
.
And
the
two
new
families
,
or
orders
,
are
descended
from
two
species
of
the
original
genus
,
and
these
are
supposed
to
be
descended
from
some
still
more
ancient
and
unknown
form
.
We
have
seen
that
in
each
country
it
is
the
species
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
which
oftenest
present
varieties
or
incipient
species
.
This
,
indeed
,
might
have
been
expected
;
for
,
as
natural
selection
acts
through
one
form
having
some
advantage
over
other
forms
in
the
struggle
for
existence
,
it
will
chiefly
act
on
those
which
already
have
some
advantage
;
and
the
largeness
of
any
group
shows
that
its
species
have
inherited
from
a
common
ancestor
some
advantage
in
common
.
Hence
,
the
struggle
for
the
production
of
new
and
modified
descendants
will
mainly
lie
between
the
larger
groups
which
are
all
trying
to
increase
in
number
.
One
large
group
will
slowly
conquer
another
large
group
,
reduce
its
numbers
,
and
thus
lessen
its
chance
of
further
variation
and
improvement
.
Within
the
same
large
group
,
the
later
and
more
highly
perfected
sub
groups
,
from
branching
out
and
seizing
on
many
new
places
in
the
polity
of
Nature
,
will
constantly
tend
to
supplant
and
destroy
the
earlier
and
less
improved
sub
groups
.
Small
and
broken
groups
and
sub
groups
will
finally
disappear
.
Looking
to
the
future
,
we
can
predict
that
the
groups
of
organic
beings
which
are
now
large
and
triumphant
,
and
which
are
least
broken
up
,
that
is
,
which
have
as
yet
suffered
least
extinction
,
will
,
for
a
long
period
,
continue
to
increase
.
But
which
groups
will
ultimately
prevail
,
no
man
can
predict
;
for
we
know
that
many
groups
formerly
most
extensively
developed
,
have
now
become
extinct
.
Looking
still
more
remotely
to
the
future
,
we
may
predict
that
,
owing
to
the
continued
and
steady
increase
of
the
larger
groups
,
a
multitude
of
smaller
groups
will
become
utterly
extinct
,
and
leave
no
modified
descendants
;
and
consequently
that
,
of
the
species
living
at
any
one
period
,
extremely
few
will
transmit
descendants
to
a
remote
futurity
.
I
shall
have
to
return
to
this
subject
in
the
chapter
on
Classification
,
but
I
may
add
that
as
,
according
to
this
view
,
extremely
few
of
the
more
ancient
species
have
transmitted
descendants
to
the
present
day
,
and
,
as
all
the
descendants
of
the
same
species
form
a
class
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
there
exist
so
few
classes
in
each
main
division
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
.
Although
few
of
the
most
ancient
species
have
left
modified
descendants'
yet
,
at
remote
geological
periods
,
the
earth
may
have
been
almost
as
well
peopled
with
species
of
many
genera
,
families
,
orders
,
and
classes
,
as
at
the
present
time
.
On
the
Degree
to
which
Organisation
tends
to
advance
Natural
Selection
acts
exclusively
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
variations
,
which
are
beneficial
under
the
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
to
which
each
creature
is
exposed
at
all
periods
of
life
.
The
ultimate
result
is
that
each
creature
tends
to
become
more
and
more
improved
in
relation
to
its
conditions
.
This
improvement
inevitable
leads
to
the
gradual
advancement
of
the
organisation
of
the
greater
number
of
living
beings
throughout
the
world
.
But
here
we
enter
on
a
very
intricate
subject
,
for
naturalists
have
not
defined
to
each
other's
satisfaction
what
is
meant
by
an
advance
in
organisation
.
Amongst
the
vertebrata
the
degree
of
intellect
and
an
approach
in
structure
to
man
clearly
come
into
play
.
It
might
be
thought
that
the
amount
of
change
which
the
various
parts
and
organs
pass
through
in
their
development
from
the
embryo
to
maturity
would
suffice
as
a
standard
of
comparison
;
but
there
are
cases
,
as
with
certain
parasitic
crustaceans
,
in
which
several
parts
of
the
structure
become
less
perfect
,
so
that
the
mature
animal
cannot
be
called
higher
than
its
larva
.
Von
Baer's
standard
seems
the
most
widely
applicable
and
the
best
,
namely
,
the
amount
of
differentiation
of
the
parts
of
the
same
organic
being
,
in
the
adult
state
as
I
should
be
inclined
to
add
,
and
their
specialisation
for
different
functions
;
or
,
as
Milne
Edwards
would
express
it
,
the
completeness
of
the
division
of
physiological
labour
.
But
we
shall
see
how
obscure
this
subject
is
if
we
look
,
for
instance
,
to
fishes
,
amongst
which
some
naturalists
rank
those
as
highest
which
,
like
the
sharks
,
approach
nearest
to
amphibians
;
whilst
other
naturalists
rank
the
common
bony
or
teleostean
fishes
as
the
highest
,
inasmuch
as
they
are
most
strictly
fish
like
and
differ
most
from
the
other
vertebrate
classes
.
We
see
still
more
plainly
the
obscurity
of
the
subject
by
turning
to
plants
,
amongst
which
the
standard
of
intellect
is
of
course
quite
excluded
;
and
here
some
botanists
rank
those
plants
as
highest
which
have
every
organ
,
as
sepals
,
petals
,
stamens
,
and
pistils
,
fully
developed
in
each
flower
;
whereas
other
botanists
,
probably
with
more
truth
,
look
at
the
plants
which
have
their
several
organs
much
modified
and
reduced
in
number
as
the
highest
.
If
we
take
as
the
standard
of
high
organisation
,
the
amount
of
differentiation
and
specialisation
of
the
several
organs
in
each
being
when
adult
(
and
this
will
include
the
advancement
of
the
brain
for
intellectual
purposes
)
,
natural
selection
clearly
leads
towards
this
standard
:
for
all
physiologists
admit
that
the
specialisation
of
organs
,
inasmuch
as
in
this
state
they
perform
their
functions
better
,
is
an
advantage
to
each
being
;
and
hence
the
accumulation
of
variations
tending
towards
specialisation
is
within
the
scope
of
natural
selection
.
On
the
other
hand
,
we
can
see
,
bearing
in
mind
that
all
organic
beings
are
striving
to
increase
at
a
high
ratio
and
to
seize
on
every
unoccupied
or
less
well
occupied
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
that
it
is
quite
possible
for
natural
selection
gradually
to
fit
a
being
to
a
situation
in
which
several
organs
would
be
superfluous
or
useless
:
in
such
cases
there
would
be
retrogression
in
the
scale
of
organisation
.
Whether
organisation
on
the
whole
has
actually
advanced
from
the
remotest
geological
periods
to
the
present
day
will
be
more
conveniently
discussed
in
our
chapter
on
Geological
Succession
.
But
it
may
be
objected
that
if
all
organic
beings
thus
tend
to
rise
in
the
scale
,
how
is
it
that
throughout
the
world
a
multitude
of
the
lowest
forms
still
exist
;
and
how
is
it
that
in
each
great
class
some
forms
are
far
more
highly
developed
than
others
?
Why
have
not
the
more
highly
developed
forms
everywhere
supplanted
and
exterminated
the
lower
?
Lamarck
,
who
believed
in
an
innate
and
inevitable
tendency
towards
perfection
in
all
organic
beings
,
seems
to
have
felt
this
difficulty
so
strongly
,
that
he
was
led
to
suppose
that
new
and
simple
forms
are
continually
being
produced
by
spontaneous
generation
.
Science
has
not
as
yet
proved
the
truth
of
this
belief
,
whatever
the
future
may
reveal
.
On
our
theory
the
continued
existence
of
lowly
organisms
offers
no
difficulty
;
for
natural
selection
,
or
the
survival
of
the
fittest
,
does
not
necessarily
include
progressive
development
it
only
takes
advantage
of
such
variations
as
arise
and
are
beneficial
to
each
creature
under
its
complex
relations
of
life
.
And
it
may
be
asked
what
advantage
,
as
far
as
we
can
see
,
would
it
be
to
an
infusorian
animalcule
to
an
intestinal
worm
or
even
to
an
earthworm
,
to
be
highly
organised
.
If
it
were
no
advantage
,
these
forms
would
be
left
,
by
natural
selection
,
unimproved
or
but
little
improved
,
and
might
remain
for
indefinite
ages
in
their
present
lowly
condition
.
And
geology
tells
us
that
some
of
the
lowest
forms
,
as
the
infusoria
and
rhizopods
,
have
remained
for
an
enormous
period
in
nearly
their
present
state
.
But
to
suppose
that
most
of
the
many
now
existing
low
forms
have
not
in
the
least
advanced
since
the
first
dawn
of
life
would
be
extremely
rash
;
for
every
naturalist
who
has
dissected
some
of
the
beings
now
ranked
as
very
low
in
the
scale
,
must
have
been
struck
with
their
really
wondrous
and
beautiful
organisation
.
Nearly
the
same
remarks
are
applicable
if
we
look
to
the
different
grades
of
organisation
within
the
same
great
group
;
for
instance
,
in
the
vertebrata
,
to
the
co
existence
of
mammals
and
fish
amongst
mammalia
,
to
the
coexistence
of
man
and
the
Ornithorhynchus
amongst
fishes
,
to
the
co
existence
of
the
shark
and
the
lancelet
(
Amphioxus
)
,
which
latter
fish
in
the
extreme
simplicity
of
its
structure
approaches
the
invertebrate
classes
.
But
mammals
and
fish
hardly
come
into
competition
with
each
other
;
the
advancement
of
the
whole
class
of
mammals
,
or
of
certain
members
in
this
class
,
to
the
highest
grade
would
not
lead
to
their
taking
the
place
of
fishes
.
Physiologists
believe
that
the
brain
must
be
bathed
by
warm
blood
to
be
highly
active
,
and
this
requires
aerial
respiration
;
so
that
warm
blooded
mammals
when
inhabiting
the
water
lie
under
a
disadvantage
in
having
to
come
continually
to
the
surface
to
breathe
.
With
fishes
,
members
of
the
shark
family
would
not
tend
to
supplant
the
lancelet
;
for
the
lancelet
,
as
I
hear
from
Fritz
Muller
,
has
as
sole
companion
and
competitor
on
the
barren
sandy
shore
of
South
Brazil
,
an
anomalous
annelid
.
The
three
lowest
orders
of
mammals
,
namely
,
marsupials
,
edentata
,
and
rodents
,
co
exist
in
South
America
in
the
same
region
with
numerous
monkeys
,
and
probably
interfere
little
with
each
other
.
Although
organisation
,
on
the
whole
,
may
have
advanced
and
be
still
advancing
throughout
the
world
,
yet
the
scale
will
always
present
many
degrees
of
perfection
;
for
the
high
advancement
of
certain
whole
classes
,
or
of
certain
members
of
each
class
,
does
not
at
all
necessarily
lead
to
the
extinction
of
those
groups
with
which
they
do
not
enter
into
close
competition
.
In
some
cases
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
lowly
organised
forms
appear
to
have
been
preserved
to
the
present
day
,
from
inhabiting
confined
or
peculiar
stations
,
where
they
have
been
subjected
to
less
severe
competition
,
and
where
their
scanty
numbers
have
retarded
the
chance
of
favourable
variations
arising
.
Finally
,
I
believe
that
many
lowly
organised
forms
now
exist
throughout
the
world
,
from
various
causes
.
In
some
cases
variations
or
individual
differences
of
a
favourable
nature
may
never
have
arisen
for
natural
selection
to
act
on
and
accumulate
.
In
no
case
,
probably
,
has
time
sufficed
for
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
development
.
In
some
few
cases
there
has
been
what
we
must
call
retrogression
of
organisation
.
But
the
main
cause
lies
in
the
fact
that
under
very
simple
conditions
of
life
a
high
organisation
would
be
of
no
service
,
possibly
would
be
of
actual
disservice
,
as
being
of
a
more
delicate
nature
,
and
more
liable
to
be
put
out
of
order
and
injured
.
Looking
to
the
first
dawn
of
life
,
when
all
organic
beings
,
as
we
may
believe
,
presented
the
simplest
structure
,
how
,
it
has
been
asked
,
could
the
first
steps
in
the
advancement
or
differentiation
of
parts
have
arisen
?
Mr
.
Herbert
Spencer
would
probably
answer
that
,
as
soon
as
simple
unicellular
organism
came
by
growth
or
division
to
be
compounded
of
several
cells
,
or
became
attached
to
any
supporting
surface
,
his
law
"
that
homologous
units
of
any
order
become
differentiated
in
proportion
as
their
relations
to
incident
forces
"
would
come
into
action
.
But
as
we
have
no
facts
to
guide
us
,
speculation
on
the
subject
is
almost
useless
.
It
is
,
however
,
an
error
to
suppose
that
there
would
be
no
struggle
for
existence
,
and
,
consequently
,
no
natural
selection
,
until
many
forms
had
been
produced
:
variations
in
a
single
species
inhabiting
an
isolated
station
might
be
beneficial
,
and
thus
the
whole
mass
of
individuals
might
be
modified
,
or
two
distinct
forms
might
arise
.
But
,
as
I
remarked
towards
the
close
of
the
Introduction
,
no
one
ought
to
feel
surprise
at
much
remaining
as
yet
unexplained
on
the
origin
of
species
,
if
we
make
due
allowance
for
our
profound
ignorance
on
the
mutual
relations
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
at
the
present
time
,
and
still
more
so
during
past
ages
.
Convergence
of
Character
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
thinks
that
I
have
overrated
the
importance
of
divergence
of
character
(
in
which
,
however
,
he
apparently
believes
)
and
that
convergence
,
as
it
may
be
called
,
has
likewise
played
a
part
.
If
two
species
,
belonging
to
two
distinct
though
allied
genera
,
had
both
produced
a
large
number
of
new
and
divergent
forms
,
it
is
conceivable
that
these
might
approach
each
other
so
closely
that
they
would
have
all
to
be
classed
under
the
same
genus
;
and
thus
the
descendants
of
two
distinct
genera
would
converge
into
one
.
But
it
would
in
most
cases
be
extremely
rash
to
attribute
to
convergence
a
close
and
general
similarity
of
structure
in
the
modified
descendants
of
widely
distinct
forms
.
The
shape
of
a
crystal
is
determined
solely
by
the
molecular
forces
,
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
dissimilar
substances
should
sometimes
assume
the
same
form
;
but
with
organic
beings
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
form
of
each
depends
on
an
infinitude
of
complex
relations
,
namely
on
the
variations
which
have
arisen
,
these
being
due
to
causes
far
too
intricate
to
be
followed
out
,
on
the
nature
of
the
variations
which
have
been
preserved
or
selected
,
and
this
depends
on
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
,
and
in
a
still
higher
degree
on
the
surrounding
organisms
with
which
each
being
has
come
into
competition
,
and
lastly
,
on
inheritance
(
in
itself
a
fluctuating
element
)
from
innumerable
progenitors
,
all
of
which
have
had
their
forms
determined
through
equally
complex
relations
.
It
is
incredible
that
the
descendants
of
two
organisms
,
which
had
originally
differed
in
a
marked
manner
,
should
ever
afterwards
converge
so
closely
as
to
lead
to
a
near
approach
to
identity
throughout
their
whole
organisation
.
If
this
had
occurred
,
we
should
meet
with
the
same
form
,
independently
of
genetic
connection
,
recurring
in
widely
separated
geological
formations
;
and
the
balance
of
evidence
is
opposed
to
any
such
an
admission
.
Mr
.
Watson
has
also
objected
that
the
continued
action
of
natural
selection
,
together
with
divergence
of
character
,
would
tend
to
make
an
indefinite
number
of
specific
forms
.
As
far
as
mere
inorganic
conditions
are
concerned
,
it
seems
probable
that
a
sufficient
number
of
species
would
soon
become
adapted
to
all
considerable
diversities
of
heat
,
moisture
,
&c
.
;
but
I
fully
admit
that
the
mutual
relations
of
organic
beings
are
more
important
;
and
as
the
number
of
species
in
any
country
goes
on
increasing
,
the
organic
conditions
of
life
must
become
more
and
more
complex
.
Consequently
there
seems
at
first
sight
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
profitable
diversification
of
structure
,
and
therefore
no
limit
to
the
number
of
species
which
might
be
produced
.
We
do
not
know
that
even
the
most
prolific
area
is
fully
stocked
with
specific
forms
:
at
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
and
in
Australia
,
which
support
such
an
astonishing
number
of
species
,
many
European
plants
have
become
naturalised
.
But
geology
shows
us
,
that
from
an
early
part
of
the
tertiary
period
the
number
of
species
of
shells
,
and
that
from
the
middle
part
of
this
same
period
the
number
of
mammals
,
has
not
greatly
or
at
all
increased
.
What
then
checks
an
indefinite
increase
in
the
number
of
species
?
The
amount
of
life
(
I
do
not
mean
the
number
of
specific
forms
)
supported
on
an
area
must
have
a
limit
,
depending
so
largely
as
it
does
on
physical
conditions
;
therefore
,
if
an
area
be
inhabited
by
very
many
species
,
each
or
nearly
each
species
will
be
represented
by
few
individuals
;
and
such
species
will
be
liable
to
extermination
from
accidental
fluctuations
in
the
nature
of
the
seasons
or
in
the
number
of
their
enemies
.
The
process
of
extermination
in
such
cases
would
be
rapid
,
whereas
the
production
of
new
species
must
always
be
slow
.
Imagine
the
extreme
case
of
as
many
species
as
individuals
in
England
,
and
the
first
severe
winter
or
very
dry
summer
would
exterminate
thousands
on
thousands
of
species
.
Rare
species
,
and
each
species
will
become
rare
if
the
number
of
species
in
any
country
becomes
indefinitely
increased
,
will
,
on
the
principle
often
explained
,
present
within
a
given
period
few
favourable
variations
;
consequently
,
the
process
of
giving
birth
to
new
specific
forms
would
thus
be
retarded
.
When
any
species
becomes
very
rare
,
close
interbreeding
will
help
to
exterminate
it
;
authors
have
thought
that
this
comes
into
play
in
accounting
for
the
deterioration
of
the
aurochs
in
Lithuania
,
of
red
deer
in
Scotland
,
and
of
bears
in
Norway
,
&e
.
Lastly
,
and
this
I
am
inclined
to
think
is
the
most
important
element
,
a
dominant
species
,
which
has
already
beaten
many
competitors
in
its
own
home
,
will
tend
to
spread
and
supplant
many
others
.
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
shown
that
those
species
which
spread
widely
,
tend
generally
to
spread
very
widely
;
consequently
,
they
will
tend
to
supplant
and
exterminate
several
species
in
several
areas
,
and
thus
cheek
the
inordinate
increase
of
specific
forms
throughout
the
world
.
Dr
.
Hooker
has
recently
shown
that
in
the
S
.
E
.
corner
of
Australia
,
where
,
apparently
,
there
are
many
invaders
from
different
quarters
of
the
globe
,
the
endemic
Australian
species
have
been
greatly
reduced
in
number
.
How
much
weight
to
attribute
to
these
several
considerations
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
conjointly
they
must
limit
in
each
country
the
tendency
to
an
indefinite
augmentation
of
specific
forms
.
Summary
of
Chapter
If
under
changing
conditions
of
life
organic
beings
present
individual
differences
in
almost
every
part
of
their
structure
,
and
this
cannot
be
disputed
;
if
there
be
,
owing
to
their
geometrical
rate
of
increase
,
a
severe
struggle
for
life
at
some
age
,
season
,
or
year
,
and
this
certainly
cannot
be
disputed
;
then
,
considering
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
relations
of
all
organic
beings
to
each
other
and
to
their
conditions
of
life
,
causing
an
infinite
diversity
in
structure
,
constitution
,
and
habits
,
to
be
advantageous
to
them
,
it
would
be
a
most
extraordinary
fact
if
no
variations
had
ever
occurred
useful
to
each
being's
own
welfare
,
in
the
same
manner
as
so
many
variations
have
occurred
useful
to
man
.
But
if
variations
useful
to
any
organic
being
ever
do
occur
,
assuredly
individuals
thus
characterised
will
have
the
best
chance
of
being
preserved
in
the
struggle
for
life
;
and
from
the
strong
principle
of
inheritance
,
these
will
tend
to
produce
offspring
similarly
characterised
.
This
principle
of
preservation
,
or
the
survival
of
the
fittest
,
I
have
called
Natural
Selection
.
It
leads
to
the
improvement
of
each
creature
in
relation
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
,
and
consequently
,
in
most
cases
,
to
what
must
be
regarded
as
an
advance
in
organisation
.
Nevertheless
,
low
and
simple
forms
will
long
endure
if
well
fitted
for
their
simple
conditions
of
life
.
Natural
selection
,
on
the
principle
of
qualities
being
inherited
at
corresponding
ages
,
can
modify
the
egg
,
seed
,
or
young
,
as
easily
as
the
adult
.
Amongst
many
animals
,
sexual
selection
will
have
given
its
aid
to
ordinary
selection
,
by
assuring
to
the
most
vigorous
and
best
adapted
males
the
greatest
number
of
offspring
.
Sexual
selection
will
also
give
characters
useful
to
the
males
alone
,
in
their
struggles
or
rivalry
with
other
males
;
and
these
characters
will
be
transmitted
to
one
sex
or
to
both
sexes
,
according
to
the
form
of
inheritance
which
prevails
.
Whether
natural
selection
has
really
thus
acted
in
adapting
the
various
forms
of
life
to
their
several
conditions
and
stations
,
must
be
judged
by
the
general
tenor
and
balance
of
evidence
given
in
the
following
chapters
.
But
we
have
already
seen
how
it
entails
extinction
;
and
how
largely
extinction
has
acted
in
the
world's
history
,
geology
plainly
declares
.
Natural
selection
also
leads
to
divergence
of
character
;
for
the
more
organic
beings
diverge
in
structure
,
habits
,
and
constitution
,
by
so
much
the
more
can
a
large
number
be
supported
on
the
area
,
of
which
we
see
proof
by
looking
to
the
inhabitants
of
any
small
spot
,
and
to
the
productions
naturalised
in
foreign
lands
.
Therefore
,
during
the
modification
of
the
descendants
of
any
one
species
,
and
during
the
incessant
struggle
of
all
species
to
increase
in
numbers
,
the
more
diversified
the
descendants
become
,
the
better
will
be
their
chance
of
success
in
the
battle
for
life
.
Thus
the
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
steadily
tend
to
increase
,
till
they
equal
the
greater
differences
between
species
of
the
same
genus
,
or
even
of
distinct
genera
.
We
have
seen
that
it
is
the
common
,
the
widely
diffused
and
widely
ranging
species
,
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
within
each
class
,
which
vary
most
;
and
these
tend
to
transmit
to
their
modified
offspring
that
superiority
which
now
makes
them
dominant
in
their
own
countries
.
Natural
selection
,
as
has
just
been
remarked
,
leads
to
divergence
of
character
and
to
much
extinction
of
the
less
improved
and
intermediate
forms
of
life
.
On
these
principles
,
the
nature
of
the
affinities
,
and
the
generally
well
defined
distinctions
between
the
innumerable
organic
beings
in
each
class
throughout
the
world
,
may
be
explained
.
It
is
a
truly
wonderful
fact
the
wonder
of
which
we
are
apt
to
overlook
from
familiarity
that
all
animals
and
all
plants
throughout
all
time
and
space
should
be
related
to
each
other
in
groups
,
subordinate
to
groups
,
in
the
manner
which
we
everywhere
behold
namely
,
varieties
of
the
same
species
most
closely
related
,
species
of
the
same
genus
less
closely
and
unequally
related
,
forming
sections
and
sub
genera
,
species
of
distinct
genera
much
less
closely
related
,
and
genera
related
in
different
degrees
,
forming
sub
families
,
families
,
orders
,
sub
classes
and
classes
.
The
several
subordinate
groups
in
any
class
cannot
be
ranked
in
a
single
file
,
but
seem
clustered
round
points
,
and
these
round
other
points
,
and
so
on
in
almost
endless
cycles
.
If
species
had
been
independently
created
,
no
explanation
would
have
been
possible
of
this
kind
of
classification
;
but
it
is
explained
through
inheritance
and
the
complex
action
of
natural
selection
,
entailing
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
,
as
we
have
seen
illustrated
in
the
diagram
.
The
affinities
of
all
the
beings
of
the
same
class
have
sometimes
been
represented
by
a
great
tree
.
I
believe
this
simile
largely
speaks
the
truth
.
The
green
and
budding
twigs
may
represent
existing
species
;
and
those
produced
during
former
years
may
represent
the
long
succession
of
extinct
species
.
At
each
period
of
growth
all
the
growing
twigs
have
tried
to
branch
out
on
all
sides
,
and
to
overtop
and
kill
the
surrounding
twigs
and
branches
,
in
the
same
manner
as
species
and
groups
of
species
have
at
all
times
overmastered
other
species
in
the
great
battle
for
life
.
The
limbs
,
divided
into
great
branches
,
and
these
into
lesser
and
lesser
branches
,
were
themselves
once
,
when
the
tree
was
young
,
budding
twigs
,
and
this
connection
of
the
former
and
present
buds
by
ramifying
branches
may
well
represent
the
classification
of
all
extinct
and
living
species
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
.
Of
the
many
twigs
which
flourished
when
the
tree
was
a
mere
bush
,
only
two
or
three
,
now
grown
into
great
branches
,
yet
survive
and
bear
the
other
branches
;
so
with
the
species
which
lived
during
long
past
geological
periods
very
few
have
left
living
and
modified
descendants
.
From
the
first
growth
of
the
tree
,
many
a
limb
and
branch
has
decayed
and
dropped
off
;
and
these
fallen
branches
of
various
sizes
may
represent
those
whole
orders
,
families
,
and
genera
which
have
now
no
living
representatives
,
and
which
are
known
to
us
only
in
a
fossil
state
.
As
we
here
and
there
see
a
thin
straggling
branch
springing
from
,
a
fork
low
down
in
a
tree
,
and
which
by
some
chance
has
been
favoured
and
is
still
alive
on
its
summit
,
so
we
occasionally
see
an
animal
like
the
Ornithorhynchus
or
Lepidosiren
,
which
in
some
small
degree
connects
by
its
affinities
two
large
branches
of
life
,
and
which
has
apparently
been
saved
from
fatal
competition
by
having
inhabited
a
protected
station
.
As
buds
give
rise
by
growth
to
fresh
buds
,
and
these
,
if
vigorous
,
branch
out
and
overtop
on
all
sides
many
a
feebler
branch
,
so
by
generation
I
believe
it
has
been
with
the
great
Tree
of
Life
,
which
fills
with
its
dead
and
broken
branches
the
crust
of
the
earth
,
and
covers
the
surface
with
its
everbranching
and
beautiful
ramifications
.
CHAPTER
V
LAWS
OF
VARIATION
I
HAVE
hitherto
sometimes
spoken
as
if
the
variations
so
common
and
multiform
with
organic
beings
under
domestication
,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
with
those
under
nature
were
due
to
chance
.
This
,
of
course
,
is
a
wholly
incorrect
expression
,
but
it
serves
to
acknowledge
plainly
our
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
each
particular
variation
.
Some
authors
believe
it
to
be
as
much
the
function
of
the
reproductive
system
to
produce
individual
differences
,
or
slight
deviations
of
structure
,
as
to
make
the
child
like
its
parents
.
But
the
fact
of
variations
and
monstrosities
occurring
much
more
frequently
under
domestication
than
under
nature
,
and
the
greater
variability
of
species
having
wider
ranges
than
of
those
with
restricted
ranges
,
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
variability
is
generally
related
to
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
each
species
has
been
exposed
during
several
successive
generations
.
In
the
first
chapter
I
attempted
to
show
that
changed
conditions
act
in
two
ways
,
directly
on
the
whole
organisation
or
on
certain
parts
alone
,
and
indirectly
through
the
reproductive
system
.
In
all
cases
there
are
two
factors
,
the
nature
of
the
organism
,
which
is
much
the
most
important
of
the
two
,
and
the
nature
of
the
conditions
.
The
direct
action
of
changed
conditions
leads
to
definite
or
indefinite
results
.
In
the
latter
case
the
organisation
seems
to
become
plastic
,
and
we
have
much
fluctuating
variability
.
In
the
former
case
the
nature
of
the
organism
is
such
that
it
yields
readily
,
when
subjected
to
certain
conditions
,
and
all
,
or
nearly
all
the
individuals
become
modified
in
the
same
way
.
It
is
very
difficult
to
decide
how
far
changed
conditions
,
such
as
of
climate
,
food
,
&c
.
,
have
acted
in
a
definite
manner
.
There
is
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
effects
have
been
greater
than
can
be
proved
by
clear
evidence
.
But
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
innumerable
complex
co
adaptations
of
structure
,
which
we
see
throughout
nature
between
various
organic
beings
,
cannot
be
attributed
simply
to
such
action
.
In
the
following
cases
the
conditions
seem
to
have
produced
some
slight
definite
effect
:
E
.
Forbes
asserts
that
shells
at
their
southern
limit
,
and
when
living
in
shallow
water
,
are
more
brightly
coloured
than
those
of
the
same
species
from
further
north
or
from
a
greater
depth
;
but
this
certainly
does
not
always
hold
good
.
Mr
.
Gould
believes
that
birds
of
the
same
species
are
more
brightly
coloured
under
a
clear
atmosphere
,
than
when
living
near
the
coast
or
on
islands
,
and
Wollaston
is
convinced
that
residence
near
the
sea
affects
the
colours
of
insects
.
Moquin
Tandon
gives
a
list
of
plants
which
,
when
growing
near
the
sea
shore
,
have
their
leaves
in
some
degree
fleshy
,
though
not
elsewhere
fleshy
.
These
slightly
varying
organisms
are
interesting
in
as
far
as
they
present
characters
analogous
to
those
possessed
by
the
species
which
are
confined
to
similar
conditions
.
When
a
variation
is
of
the
slightest
use
to
any
being
,
we
cannot
tell
how
much
to
attribute
to
the
accumulative
action
of
natural
selection
,
and
how
much
to
the
definite
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
.
Thus
,
it
is
well
known
to
furriers
that
animals
of
the
same
species
have
thicker
and
better
fur
the
further
north
they
live
;
but
who
can
tell
how
much
of
this
difference
may
be
due
to
the
warmest
clad
individuals
having
been
favoured
and
preserved
during
many
generations
,
and
how
much
to
the
action
of
the
severe
climate
?
for
it
would
appear
that
climate
has
some
direct
action
on
the
hair
of
our
domestic
quadrupeds
.
Instances
could
be
given
of
similar
varieties
being
produced
from
the
same
species
under
external
conditions
of
life
as
different
as
can
well
be
conceived
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
of
dissimilar
varieties
being
produced
under
apparently
the
same
external
conditions
.
Again
,
innumerable
instances
are
known
to
every
naturalist
,
of
species
keeping
true
,
or
not
varying
at
all
,
although
living
under
the
most
opposite
climates
.
Such
considerations
as
these
incline
me
to
lay
less
weight
on
the
direct
action
of
the
surrounding
conditions
,
than
on
a
tendency
to
vary
,
due
to
causes
of
which
we
are
quite
ignorant
.
In
one
sense
the
conditions
of
life
may
be
said
,
not
only
to
cause
variability
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
but
likewise
to
include
natural
selection
,
for
the
conditions
determine
whether
this
or
that
variety
shall
survive
.
But
when
man
is
the
selecting
agent
,
we
clearly
see
that
the
two
elements
of
change
are
distinct
;
variability
is
in
some
manner
excited
,
but
it
is
the
will
of
man
which
accumulates
the
variations
in
certain
directions
;
and
it
is
this
latter
agency
which
answers
to
the
survival
of
the
fittest
under
nature
.
Effects
of
the
increased
Use
and
Disuse
of
Parts
,
as
controlled
by
Natural
Selection
From
the
facts
alluded
to
in
the
first
chapter
,
I
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
use
in
our
domestic
animals
has
strengthened
and
enlarged
certain
parts
,
and
disuse
diminished
them
;
and
that
such
modifications
are
inherited
.
Under
free
nature
,
we
have
no
standard
of
comparison
,
by
which
to
judge
of
the
effects
of
long
continued
use
or
disuse
,
for
we
know
not
the
parent
forms
;
but
many
animals
possess
structures
which
can
be
best
explained
by
the
effects
of
disuse
.
As
Professor
Owen
has
remarked
,
there
is
no
greater
anomaly
in
nature
than
a
bird
that
cannot
fly
;
yet
there
are
several
in
this
state
.
The
logger
headed
duck
of
South
America
can
only
flap
along
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
has
its
wings
in
nearly
the
same
condition
as
the
domestic
Aylesbury
duck
:
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
young
birds
,
according
to
Mr
.
Cunningham
,
can
fly
,
while
the
adults
have
lost
this
power
.
As
the
larger
ground
feeding
birds
seldom
take
flight
except
to
escape
danger
,
it
is
probable
that
the
nearly
wingless
condition
of
several
birds
,
now
inhabiting
or
which
lately
inhabited
several
oceanic
islands
,
tenanted
by
no
beast
of
prey
,
has
been
caused
by
disuse
.
The
ostrich
indeed
inhabits
continents
,
and
is
exposed
to
danger
from
which
it
cannot
escape
by
flight
,
but
it
can
defend
itself
by
kicking
its
enemies
,
as
efficiently
as
many
quadrupeds
.
We
may
believe
that
the
progenitor
of
the
ostrich
genus
had
habits
like
those
of
the
bustard
,
and
that
,
as
the
size
and
weight
of
its
body
were
increased
during
successive
generations
,
its
legs
were
used
more
,
and
its
wings
less
,
until
they
became
incapable
of
flight
.
Kirby
has
remarked
(
and
I
have
observed
the
same
fact
)
that
the
anterior
tarsi
,
or
feet
,
of
many
male
dung
feeding
beetles
are
often
broken
off
;
he
examined
seventeen
specimens
in
his
own
collection
,
and
not
one
had
even
a
relic
left
.
In
the
Onites
apelles
the
tarsi
are
so
habitually
lost
,
that
the
insect
has
been
described
as
not
having
them
.
In
some
other
genera
they
are
present
,
but
in
a
rudimentary
condition
.
In
the
Ateuchus
,
or
sacred
beetle
of
the
Egyptians
,
they
are
totally
deficient
.
The
evidence
that
accidental
mutilations
can
be
inherited
is
at
present
not
decisive
;
but
the
remarkable
cases
observed
by
Brown
Sequard
in
guinea
pigs
,
of
the
inherited
effects
of
operations
,
should
make
us
cautious
in
denying
this
tendency
.
Hence
it
will
perhaps
be
safest
to
look
at
the
entire
absence
of
the
anterior
tarsi
in
Ateuchus
,
and
their
rudimentary
condition
in
some
other
genera
,
not
as
cases
of
inherited
mutilations
,
but
as
due
to
the
effects
of
long
continued
disuse
;
for
as
many
dung
feeding
beetles
are
generally
found
with
their
tarsi
lost
,
this
must
happen
early
in
life
;
therefore
the
tarsi
cannot
be
of
much
importance
or
be
much
used
by
these
insects
.
In
some
cases
we
might
easily
put
down
to
disuse
modifications
of
structure
which
are
wholly
,
or
mainly
,
due
to
natural
selection
.
Mr
.
Wollaston
has
discovered
the
remarkable
fact
that
200
beetles
,
out
of
the
550
species
(
but
more
are
now
known
)
inhabiting
Madeira
,
are
so
far
deficient
in
wings
that
they
cannot
fly
;
and
that
,
of
the
twenty
nine
endemic
genera
,
no
less
than
twenty
three
have
all
their
species
in
this
condition!
Several
facts
,
namely
,
that
beetles
in
many
parts
of
the
world
are
frequently
blown
to
sea
and
perish
;
that
the
beetles
in
Madeira
,
as
observed
by
Mr
.
Wollaston
,
lie
much
concealed
,
until
the
wind
lulls
and
the
sun
shines
;
that
the
proportion
of
wingless
beetles
is
larger
on
the
exposed
Desertas
than
in
Madeira
itself
;
and
especially
the
extraordinary
fact
,
so
strongly
insisted
on
by
Mr
.
Wollaston
,
that
certain
large
groups
of
beetles
,
elsewhere
excessively
numerous
,
which
absolutely
require
the
use
of
their
wings
,
are
here
almost
entirely
absent
;
these
several
considerations
make
me
believe
that
the
wingless
condition
of
so
many
Madeira
beetles
is
mainly
due
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
,
combined
probably
with
disuse
.
For
during
many
successive
generations
each
individual
beetle
which
flew
least
,
either
from
its
wings
having
been
ever
so
little
less
perfectly
developed
or
from
indolent
habit
,
will
have
had
the
best
chance
of
surviving
from
not
being
blown
out
to
sea
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
those
beetles
which
most
readily
took
to
flight
would
oftenest
have
been
blown
to
sea
,
and
thus
destroyed
.
The
insects
in
Madeira
which
are
not
ground
feeders
,
and
which
,
as
certain
flower
feeding
coleoptera
and
lepidoptera
,
must
habitually
use
their
wings
to
gain
their
subsistence
,
have
,
as
Mr
.
Wollaston
suspects
,
their
wings
not
at
all
reduced
,
but
even
enlarged
.
This
is
quite
compatible
with
the
action
of
natural
selection
.
For
when
a
new
insect
first
arrived
on
the
island
,
the
tendency
of
natural
selection
to
enlarge
or
to
reduce
the
wings
,
would
depend
on
whether
a
greater
number
of
individuals
were
saved
by
successfully
battling
with
the
winds
,
or
by
giving
up
the
attempt
and
rarely
or
never
flying
.
As
with
mariners
shipwrecked
near
a
coast
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
good
swimmers
if
they
had
been
able
to
swim
still
further
,
whereas
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
bad
swimmers
if
they
had
not
been
able
to
swim
at
all
and
had
stuck
to
the
wreck
.
The
eyes
of
moles
and
of
some
burrowing
rodents
are
rudimentary
in
size
,
and
in
some
cases
are
quite
covered
by
skin
and
fur
.
This
state
of
the
eyes
is
probably
due
to
gradual
reduction
from
disuse
,
but
aided
perhaps
by
natural
selection
.
In
South
America
,
a
burrowing
rodent
,
the
tucotuco
,
or
Ctenomys
,
is
even
more
subterranean
in
its
habits
than
the
mole
;
and
I
was
assured
by
a
Spaniard
,
who
had
often
caught
them
,
that
they
were
frequently
blind
.
One
which
I
kept
alive
was
certainly
in
this
condition
,
the
cause
,
as
appeared
on
dissection
,
having
been
inflammation
of
the
nictitating
membrane
.
As
frequent
inflammation
of
the
eyes
must
be
injurious
to
any
animal
,
and
as
eyes
are
certainly
not
necessary
to
animals
having
subterranean
habits
,
a
reduction
in
their
size
,
with
the
adhesion
of
the
eyelids
and
growth
of
fur
over
them
,
might
in
such
case
be
an
advantage
;
and
if
so
,
natural
selection
would
aid
the
effects
of
disuse
.
It
is
well
known
that
several
animals
,
belonging
to
the
most
different
classes
,
which
inhabit
the
caves
of
Carniola
and
of
Kentucky
,
are
blind
.
in
some
of
the
crabs
the
foot
stalk
for
the
eye
remains
,
though
the
eye
is
gone
;
the
stand
for
the
telescope
is
there
,
though
the
telescope
with
its
glasses
has
been
lost
.
As
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
eyes
,
though
useless
,
could
be
in
any
way
injurious
to
animals
living
in
darkness
,
their
loss
may
be
attributed
to
disuse
.
In
one
of
the
blind
animals
,
namely
,
the
cave
rat
(
Noetoma
)
,
two
of
which
were
captured
by
Professor
Silliman
at
above
half
a
mile
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
and
therefore
not
in
the
profoundest
depths
,
the
eyes
were
lustrous
and
of
large
size
;
and
these
animals
,
as
I
am
informed
by
Professor
Silliman
,
after
having
been
exposed
for
about
a
month
to
a
graduated
light
,
acquired
a
dim
perception
of
objects
.
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
conditions
of
life
more
similar
than
deep
limestone
caverns
under
a
nearly
similar
climate
;
so
that
,
in
accordance
with
the
old
view
of
the
blind
animals
having
been
separately
created
for
the
American
and
European
caverns
,
very
close
similarity
in
their
organisation
and
affinities
might
have
been
expected
.
This
is
certainly
not
the
case
if
we
look
at
the
two
whole
faunas
;
and
with
respect
to
the
insects
alone
,
Schiodte
has
remarked
,
"
We
are
accordingly
prevented
from
considering
the
entire
phenomenon
in
any
other
light
than
something
purely
local
,
and
the
similarity
which
is
exhibited
in
a
few
forms
between
the
Mammoth
cave
(
in
Kentucky
)
and
the
caves
in
Carniola
,
otherwise
than
as
a
very
plain
expression
of
that
analogy
which
subsists
generally
between
the
fauna
of
Europe
and
of
North
America
.
"
On
my
view
we
must
suppose
that
American
animals
,
having
in
most
cases
ordinary
powers
of
vision
,
slowly
migrated
by
successive
generations
from
the
outer
world
into
the
deeper
and
deeper
recesses
of
the
Kentucky
caves
,
as
did
European
animals
into
the
caves
of
Europe
.
We
have
some
evidence
of
this
gradation
of
habit
;
for
,
as
Schiodte
remarks
,
"
We
accordingly
look
upon
the
subterranean
faunas
as
small
ramifications
which
have
penetrated
into
the
earth
from
the
geographically
limited
faunas
of
the
adjacent
tracts
,
and
which
,
as
they
extended
themselves
into
darkness
,
have
been
accommodated
to
surrounding
circumstances
.
Animals
not
far
remote
from
ordinary
forms
,
prepare
the
transition
from
light
to
darkness
.
Next
follow
those
that
are
constructed
for
twilight
;
and
,
last
of
all
,
those
destined
for
total
darkness
,
and
whose
formation
is
quite
peculiar
.
"
These
remarks
of
Schiodte's
it
should
be
understood
,
apply
not
to
the
same
,
but
to
distinct
species
.
By
the
time
that
an
animal
had
reached
,
after
numberless
generations
,
the
deepest
recesses
,
disuse
will
on
this
view
have
more
or
less
perfectly
obliterated
its
eyes
,
and
natural
selection
will
often
have
effected
other
changes
,
such
as
an
increase
in
the
length
of
the
antennae
or
palpi
,
as
a
compensation
for
blindness
.
Notwithstanding
such
modifications
,
we
might
expect
still
to
see
in
the
cave
animals
of
America
,
affinities
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
that
continent
,
and
in
those
of
Europe
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
European
continent
.
And
this
is
the
case
with
some
of
the
American
cave
animals
,
as
I
hear
from
Professor
Dana
;
and
some
,
of
the
European
cave
insects
are
very
closely
allied
to
those
of
the
surrounding
country
.
It
would
be
difficult
to
give
any
rational
explanation
of
the
affinities
of
the
blind
cave
animals
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
two
continents
on
the
ordinary
view
of
their
independent
creation
.
That
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
caves
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
should
be
closely
related
,
we
might
expect
from
the
well
known
relationship
of
most
of
their
other
productions
.
As
a
blind
species
of
Bathyscia
is
found
in
abundance
on
shady
rocks
far
from
caves
,
the
loss
of
vision
in
the
cave
species
of
this
one
genus
has
probably
had
no
relation
to
its
dark
habitation
;
for
it
is
natural
that
an
insect
already
deprived
of
vision
should
readily
become
adapted
to
dark
caverns
.
Another
blind
genus
(
Anophthaimus
)
offers
this
remarkable
peculiarity
,
that
the
species
,
as
Mr
.
Murray
observes
,
have
not
as
yet
been
found
anywhere
except
in
caves
;
yet
those
which
inhabit
the
several
eaves
of
Europe
and
America
are
distinct
;
but
it
is
possible
that
the
progenitors
of
these
several
species
,
whilst
they
were
furnished
with
eyes
,
may
formerly
have
ranged
over
both
continents
,
and
then
have
become
extinct
,
excepting
in
their
present
secluded
abodes
.
Far
from
feeling
surprise
that
some
of
the
cave
animals
should
be
very
anomalous
,
as
Agassiz
has
remarked
in
regard
to
the
blind
fish
,
the
Amblyopsis
,
and
as
is
the
case
with
blind
Proteus
with
reference
to
the
reptiles
of
Europe
,
I
am
only
surprised
that
more
wrecks
of
ancient
life
have
not
been
preserved
,
owing
to
the
less
severe
competition
to
which
the
scanty
inhabitants
of
these
dark
abodes
will
have
been
exposed
.
Acclimatisation
Habit
is
hereditary
with
plants
,
as
in
the
period
of
flowering
,
in
the
time
of
sleep
,
in
the
amount
of
rain
requisite
for
seeds
to
germinate
,
&c
.
,
and
this
leads
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
acclimatisation
.
As
it
is
extremely
common
for
distinct
species
belonging
to
the
same
genus
to
inhabit
hot
and
cold
countries
,
if
it
be
true
that
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
are
descended
from
a
single
parent
form
,
acclimatisation
must
be
readily
effected
during
a
long
course
of
descent
.
It
is
notorious
that
each
species
is
adapted
to
the
climate
of
its
own
home
:
species
from
an
arctic
or
even
from
a
temperate
region
cannot
endure
a
tropical
climate
,
or
conversely
.
So
again
,
many
succulent
plants
cannot
endure
a
damp
climate
.
But
the
degree
of
adaptation
of
species
to
the
climates
under
which
they
live
is
often
overrated
.
We
may
infer
this
from
our
frequent
inability
to
predict
whether
or
not
an
imported
plant
will
endure
our
climate
,
and
from
the
number
of
plants
and
animals
brought
from
different
countries
which
are
here
perfectly
healthy
.
We
have
reason
to
believe
that
species
in
a
state
of
nature
are
closely
limited
in
their
ranges
by
the
competition
of
other
organic
beings
quite
as
much
as
,
or
more
than
,
by
adaptation
to
particular
climates
.
But
whether
or
not
this
adaptation
is
in
most
cases
very
close
,
we
have
evidence
with
some
few
plants
,
of
their
becoming
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
naturally
habituated
to
different
temperatures
;
that
is
,
they
become
acclimatised
:
thus
the
pines
and
rhododendrons
,
raised
from
seed
collected
by
Dr
.
Hooker
from
the
same
species
growing
at
different
heights
on
the
Himalaya
,
were
found
to
possess
in
this
country
different
constitutional
powers
of
resisting
cold
.
Mr
.
Thwaites
informs
me
that
he
has
observed
similar
facts
in
Ceylon
;
analogous
observations
have
been
made
by
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
on
European
species
of
plants
brought
from
the
Azores
to
England
;
and
I
could
give
other
cases
.
In
regard
to
animals
,
several
authentic
instances
could
be
adduced
of
species
having
largely
extended
,
within
historical
times
,
their
range
from
warmer
to
cooler
latitudes
,
and
conversely
;
but
we
do
not
positively
know
that
these
animals
were
strictly
adapted
to
their
native
climate
,
though
in
all
ordinary
cases
we
assume
such
to
be
the
case
;
nor
do
we
know
that
they
have
subsequently
become
specially
acclimatised
to
their
new
homes
,
so
as
to
be
better
fitted
for
them
than
they
were
at
first
.
As
we
may
infer
that
our
domestic
animals
were
originally
chosen
by
uncivilised
man
because
they
were
useful
and
because
they
bred
readily
under
confinement
,
and
not
because
they
were
subsequently
found
capable
of
far
extended
transportation
,
the
common
and
extraordinary
capacity
in
our
domestic
animals
of
not
only
withstanding
the
most
different
climates
,
but
of
being
perfectly
fertile
(
a
far
severer
test
)
under
them
,
may
be
used
as
an
argument
that
a
large
proportion
of
other
animals
now
in
a
state
of
nature
could
easily
be
brought
to
bear
widely
different
climates
.
We
must
not
,
however
,
push
the
foregoing
argument
too
far
,
on
account
of
the
probable
origin
of
some
of
our
domestic
animals
from
several
wild
stocks
;
the
blood
,
for
instance
,
of
a
tropical
and
arctic
wolf
may
perhaps
be
mingled
in
our
domestic
breeds
.
The
rat
and
mouse
cannot
be
considered
as
domestic
animals
,
but
they
have
been
transported
by
man
to
many
parts
of
the
world
,
and
now
have
a
far
wider
range
than
any
other
rodent
;
for
they
live
under
the
cold
climate
of
Faroe
in
the
north
and
of
the
Falklands
in
the
south
,
and
on
many
an
island
in
the
torrid
zones
.
Hence
adaptation
to
any
special
climate
may
be
looked
at
as
a
quality
readily
grafted
on
an
innate
wide
flexibility
of
constitution
,
common
to
most
animals
.
On
this
view
,
the
capacity
of
enduring
the
most
different
climates
by
man
himself
and
by
his
domestic
animals
,
and
the
fact
of
the
extinct
elephant
and
rhinoceros
having
formerly
endured
a
glacial
climate
,
whereas
the
living
species
are
now
all
tropical
or
sub
tropical
in
their
habits
,
ought
not
to
be
looked
at
as
anomalies
,
but
as
examples
of
a
very
common
flexibility
of
constitution
,
brought
,
under
peculiar
circumstances
,
into
action
.
How
much
of
the
acclimatisation
of
species
to
any
peculiar
climate
is
due
to
mere
habit
,
and
how
much
to
the
natural
selection
of
varieties
having
different
innate
constitutions
,
and
how
much
to
both
means
combined
,
is
an
obscure
question
.
That
habit
or
custom
has
some
influence
,
I
must
believe
,
both
from
analogy
and
from
the
incessant
advice
given
in
agricultural
works
,
even
in
the
ancient
encyclopaedias
of
China
,
to
be
very
cautious
in
transporting
animals
from
one
district
to
another
.
And
as
it
is
not
likely
that
man
should
have
succeeded
in
selecting
so
many
breeds
and
sub
breeds
with
constitutions
specially
fitted
for
their
own
districts
,
the
result
must
,
I
think
,
be
due
to
habit
.
On
the
other
hand
,
natural
selection
would
inevitably
tend
to
preserve
those
individuals
which
were
born
with
constitutions
best
adapted
to
any
country
which
they
inhabited
.
In
treatises
on
many
kinds
of
cultivated
plants
,
certain
varieties
are
said
to
withstand
certain
climates
better
than
others
;
this
is
strikingly
shown
in
works
on
fruit
trees
published
in
the
United
States
,
in
which
certain
varieties
are
habitually
recommended
for
the
northern
and
others
for
the
southern
States
;
and
as
most
of
these
varieties
are
of
recent
origin
,
they
cannot
owe
their
constitutional
differences
to
habit
.
The
case
of
the
Jerusalem
artichoke
,
which
is
never
propagated
in
England
by
seed
,
and
of
which
consequently
new
varieties
have
not
been
produced
,
has
even
been
advanced
,
as
proving
that
acclimatisation
cannot
be
effected
,
for
it
is
now
as
tender
as
ever
it
was!
The
case
,
also
,
of
the
kidney
bean
has
been
often
cited
for
a
similar
purpose
,
and
with
much
greater
weight
;
but
until
someone
will
sow
,
during
a
score
of
generations
,
his
kidney
beans
so
early
that
a
very
large
proportion
are
destroyed
by
frost
,
and
then
collect
seed
from
the
few
survivors
,
with
care
to
prevent
accidental
crosses
,
and
then
again
get
seed
from
these
seedlings
,
with
the
same
precautions
,
the
experiment
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
tried
.
Nor
let
it
be
supposed
that
differences
in
the
constitution
of
seedling
kidney
beans
never
appear
,
for
an
account
has
been
published
how
much
more
hardy
some
seedlings
are
than
others
;
and
of
this
fact
I
have
myself
observed
striking
instances
.
On
the
whole
,
we
may
conclude
that
habit
,
or
use
and
disuse
,
have
,
in
some
cases
,
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
modification
of
the
constitution
and
structure
;
but
that
the
effects
have
often
been
largely
combined
with
,
and
sometimes
overmastered
by
,
the
natural
selection
of
innate
variations
.
Correlated
Variation
I
mean
by
this
expression
that
the
whole
organisation
is
so
tied
together
during
its
growth
and
development
,
that
when
slight
variations
in
any
one
part
occur
,
and
are
accumulated
through
natural
selection
,
other
parts
become
modified
.
This
is
a
very
important
subject
,
most
imperfectly
understood
,
and
no
doubt
wholly
different
classes
of
facts
may
be
here
easily
confounded
together
.
We
shall
presently
see
that
simple
inheritance
often
gives
the
false
appearance
of
correlation
.
One
of
the
most
obvious
real
cases
is
,
that
variations
of
structure
arising
in
the
young
or
larvae
naturally
tend
to
affect
the
structure
of
the
mature
animal
.
The
several
parts
of
the
body
which
are
homologous
,
and
which
,
at
an
early
embryonic
period
,
are
identical
in
structure
,
and
which
are
necessarily
exposed
to
similar
conditions
,
seem
eminently
liable
to
vary
in
a
like
manner
:
we
see
this
in
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
body
varying
in
the
same
manner
;
in
the
front
and
hind
legs
,
and
even
in
the
jaws
and
limbs
,
varying
together
,
for
the
lower
jaw
is
believed
by
some
anatomists
to
be
homologous
with
the
limbs
.
These
tendencies
,
I
do
not
doubt
,
may
be
mastered
more
or
less
completely
by
natural
selection
;
thus
a
family
of
stags
once
existed
with
an
antler
only
on
one
side
;
and
if
this
had
been
of
any
great
use
to
the
breed
,
it
might
probably
have
been
rendered
permanent
by
selection
.
Homologous
parts
,
as
has
been
remarked
by
some
authors
,
tend
to
cohere
;
this
is
often
seen
in
monstrous
plants
:
and
nothing
is
more
common
than
the
union
of
homologous
parts
in
normal
structures
,
as
in
the
union
of
the
petals
into
a
tube
.
Hard
parts
seem
to
affect
the
form
of
adjoining
soft
parts
;
it
is
believed
by
some
authors
that
with
birds
the
diversity
in
the
shape
of
the
pelvis
causes
the
remarkable
diversity
in
the
shape
of
their
kidneys
.
Others
believe
that
the
shape
of
the
pelvis
in
the
human
mother
influences
by
pressure
the
shape
of
the
head
of
the
child
.
In
snakes
,
according
to
Schlegel
,
the
form
of
the
body
and
the
manner
of
swallowing
determine
the
position
and
form
of
several
of
the
most
important
viscera
.
The
nature
of
the
bond
is
frequently
quite
obscure
.
Isidore
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire
has
forcibly
remarked
that
certain
malconformations
frequently
,
and
that
others
rarely
,
co
exist
,
without
our
being
able
assign
any
reason
.
What
can
be
more
singular
than
the
relation
in
cats
between
complete
whiteness
and
blue
eyes
with
deafness
,
or
between
the
tortoise
shell
colour
and
the
female
sex
;
or
in
pigeons
between
their
feathered
feet
and
skin
betwixt
the
outer
toes
,
or
between
the
presence
of
more
or
less
down
on
the
young
pigeon
when
first
hatched
,
with
the
future
colour
of
its
plumage
;
or
,
again
,
the
relation
between
the
hair
and
teeth
in
the
naked
Turkish
dog
,
though
here
no
doubt
homology
comes
into
play
?
With
respect
to
this
latter
case
of
correlation
,
I
think
it
can
hardly
be
accidental
,
that
the
two
orders
of
mammals
which
are
most
abnormal
in
their
dermal
covering
,
viz
.
,
Cetacea
(
whales
)
and
Edentata
(
armadilloes
,
scaly
ant
eaters
,
&c
.
,
)
are
likewise
on
the
whole
the
most
abnormal
in
their
teeth
;
but
there
are
so
many
exceptions
to
this
rule
,
as
Mr
.
Mivart
has
remarked
,
that
it
has
little
value
.
I
know
of
no
case
better
adapted
to
show
the
importance
of
the
laws
of
correlation
and
variation
,
independently
of
utility
and
therefore
of
natural
selection
,
than
that
of
the
difference
between
the
outer
and
inner
flowers
in
some
compositous
and
timbelliferous
plants
.
Every
one
is
familiar
with
the
difference
between
the
ray
and
central
florets
of
,
for
instance
,
the
daisy
,
and
this
difference
is
often
accompanied
with
the
partial
or
complete
abortion
of
the
reproductive
organs
.
But
in
some
of
these
plants
,
the
seeds
also
differ
in
shape
and
sculpture
.
These
differences
have
sometimes
been
attributed
to
the
pressure
of
the
involuera
on
the
florets
,
or
to
their
mutual
pressure
,
and
the
shape
of
the
seeds
in
the
ray
florets
of
some
Compositae
countenances
this
idea
;
but
with
the
Umbelliferae
,
it
is
by
no
means
,
as
Dr
.
Hooker
informs
me
,
the
species
with
the
densest
heads
which
most
frequently
differ
in
their
inner
and
outer
flowers
.
It
might
have
been
thought
that
the
development
of
the
ray
petals
by
drawing
nourishment
from
the
reproductive
organs
causes
their
abortion
;
but
this
can
hardly
be
the
sole
cause
,
for
in
some
Compositae
the
seeds
of
the
outer
and
inner
florets
differ
,
without
any
difference
in
the
corolla
.
Possibly
these
several
differences
may
be
connected
with
the
different
flow
of
nutriment
towards
the
central
and
external
flowers
:
we
know
,
at
least
,
that
with
irregular
flowers
,
those
nearest
to
the
axis
are
most
subject
to
peloria
,
that
is
to
become
abnormally
symmetrical
.
I
may
add
,
as
an
instance
of
this
fact
,
and
as
a
striking
case
of
correlation
,
that
in
many
pelargoniums
,
the
two
upper
petals
in
the
central
flower
of
the
truss
often
lose
their
patches
of
darker
colour
;
and
when
this
occurs
,
the
adherent
nectary
is
quite
aborted
;
the
central
flower
thus
becoming
peloric
or
regular
.
When
the
colour
is
absent
from
only
one
of
the
two
upper
petals
,
the
nectary
is
not
quite
aborted
but
is
much
shortened
.
With
respect
to
the
development
of
the
corolla
,
Sprengel's
idea
that
the
ray
florets
serve
to
attract
insects
,
whose
agency
is
highly
advantageous
or
necessary
for
the
fertilisation
of
these
plants
,
is
highly
probable
;
and
if
so
,
natural
selection
may
have
come
into
play
.
But
with
respect
to
the
seeds
,
it
seems
impossible
that
their
differences
in
shape
,
which
are
not
always
correlated
with
any
difference
in
the
corolla
,
can
be
in
any
way
beneficial
:
yet
in
the
Umbelliferae
these
differences
are
of
such
apparent
importance
the
seeds
being
sometimes
orthospermous
in
the
exterior
flowers
and
coelospermous
in
the
central
flowers
,
that
the
elder
De
Candolle
founded
his
main
divisions
in
the
order
on
such
characters
.
Hence
modifications
of
structure
,
viewed
by
systematists
as
of
high
value
,
may
be
wholly
due
to
the
laws
of
variation
and
correlation
,
without
being
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
of
the
slightest
service
to
the
species
.
We
may
often
falsely
attribute
to
correlated
variation
structures
which
are
common
to
whole
groups
of
species
,
and
which
in
truth
are
simply
due
to
inheritance
;
for
an
ancient
progenitor
may
have
acquired
through
natural
selection
some
one
modification
in
structure
,
and
,
after
thousands
of
generations
,
some
other
and
independent
modification
;
and
these
two
modifications
,
having
been
transmitted
to
a
whole
group
of
descendants
with
diverse
habits
,
would
naturally
be
thought
to
be
in
some
necessary
manner
correlated
.
Some
other
correlations
are
apparently
due
to
the
manner
in
which
natural
selection
can
alone
act
.
For
instance
,
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
remarked
that
winged
seeds
are
never
found
in
fruits
which
do
not
open
;
I
should
explain
this
rule
by
the
impossibility
of
seeds
gradually
becoming
winged
through
natural
selection
,
unless
the
capsules
were
open
;
for
in
this
case
alone
could
the
seeds
,
which
were
a
little
better
adapted
to
be
wafted
by
the
wind
,
gain
an
advantage
over
others
less
well
fitted
for
wide
dispersal
.
Compensation
and
Economy
of
Growth
The
elder
Geoffroy
and
Goethe
propounded
,
at
about
the
same
time
,
their
law
of
compensation
or
balancement
of
growth
;
or
,
as
Goethe
expressed
it
,
"
In
order
to
spend
on
one
side
,
nature
is
forced
to
economise
on
the
other
side
.
"
I
think
this
holds
true
to
a
certain
extent
with
our
domestic
productions
:
if
nourishment
flows
to
one
part
or
organ
in
excess
,
it
rarely
flows
,
at
least
in
excess
,
to
another
part
;
thus
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
cow
to
give
much
milk
and
to
fatten
readily
.
The
same
varieties
of
the
cabbage
do
not
yield
abundant
and
nutritious
foliage
and
a
copious
supply
of
oil
bearing
seeds
.
When
the
seeds
in
our
fruits
become
atrophied
,
the
fruit
itself
gains
largely
in
size
and
quality
.
In
our
poultry
,
a
large
tuft
of
feathers
on
the
head
is
generally
accompanied
by
a
diminished
comb
,
and
a
large
beard
by
diminished
wattles
.
With
species
in
a
state
of
nature
it
can
hardly
be
maintained
that
the
law
is
of
universal
application
;
but
many
good
observers
,
more
especially
botanists
,
believe
in
its
truth
.
I
will
not
,
however
,
here
give
any
instances
,
for
I
see
hardly
any
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
effects
,
on
the
one
hand
,
of
a
part
being
largely
developed
through
natural
selection
and
another
and
adjoining
part
being
reduced
by
this
same
process
or
by
disuse
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
the
actual
withdrawal
of
nutriment
from
one
part
owing
to
the
excess
of
growth
in
another
and
adjoining
part
.
I
suspect
,
also
,
that
some
of
the
cases
of
compensation
which
have
been
advanced
,
and
likewise
some
other
facts
,
may
be
merged
under
a
more
general
principle
,
namely
,
that
natural
selection
is
continually
trying
to
economise
every
part
of
the
organization
.
If
under
changed
conditions
of
life
a
structure
,
before
useful
,
becomes
less
useful
,
its
diminution
will
be
favoured
,
for
it
will
profit
the
individual
not
to
have
its
nutriment
wasted
in
building
up
an
useless
structure
.
I
can
only
thus
understand
a
fact
with
which
I
was
much
struck
when
examining
cirripedes
,
and
of
which
many
analogous
instances
could
be
given
:
namely
,
that
when
a
cirripede
is
parasitic
within
another
cirripede
and
is
thus
protected
,
it
loses
more
or
less
completely
its
own
shell
or
carapace
.
This
is
the
case
with
the
male
Ibla
,
and
in
a
truly
extraordinary
manner
with
the
Proteolepas
:
for
the
carapace
in
all
other
cirripedes
consists
of
the
three
highly
important
anterior
segments
of
the
head
enormously
developed
,
and
furnished
with
great
nerves
and
muscles
;
but
in
the
parasitic
and
protected
Proteolepas
,
the
whole
anterior
part
of
the
head
is
reduced
to
the
merest
rudiment
attached
to
the
bases
of
the
prehensile
antennae
.
Now
the
saving
of
a
large
and
complex
structure
,
when
rendered
superfluous
,
would
be
a
decided
advantage
to
each
successive
individual
of
the
species
;
for
in
the
struggle
for
life
to
which
every
animal
is
exposed
,
each
would
have
a
better
chance
of
supporting
itself
,
by
less
nutriment
being
wasted
.
Thus
,
as
I
believe
,
natural
selection
will
tend
in
the
long
run
to
reduce
any
part
of
the
organisation
,
as
soon
as
it
becomes
,
through
changed
habits
,
superfluous
,
without
by
any
means
causing
some
other
part
to
be
largely
developed
in
a
corresponding
degree
.
And
,
conversely
,
that
natural
selection
may
perfectly
well
succeed
in
largely
developing
an
organ
without
requiring
as
a
necessary
compensation
the
reduction
of
some
adjoining
part
.
Multiple
,
Rudimentary
,
and
Lowly
organised
Structures
are
Variable
It
seems
to
be
a
rule
,
as
remarked
by
the
younger
Geoffroy
,
both
with
varieties
and
species
,
that
when
any
part
or
organ
is
repeated
many
times
in
the
same
individual
(
as
the
vertebrae
in
snakes
,
and
the
stamens
in
polyandrous
flowers
)
the
number
is
variable
;
whereas
the
same
part
or
organ
,
when
it
occurs
in
lesser
numbers
,
is
constant
.
The
same
author
as
well
as
some
botanists
have
further
remarked
that
multiple
parts
are
extremely
liable
to
vary
in
structure
.
As
"
vegetable
repetition
,
"
to
use
Prof
.
Owen's
expression
,
is
a
sign
of
low
organisation
,
the
foregoing
statements
accord
with
the
common
opinion
of
naturalists
,
that
beings
which
stand
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
more
variable
than
those
which
are
higher
.
I
presume
that
lowness
here
means
that
the
several
parts
of
the
organisation
have
been
but
little
specialised
for
particular
functions
;
and
as
long
as
the
same
part
has
to
perform
diversified
work
,
we
can
perhaps
see
why
it
should
remain
variable
,
that
is
,
why
natural
selection
should
not
have
preserved
or
rejected
each
little
deviation
of
form
as
carefully
as
when
the
part
has
to
serve
for
some
one
special
purpose
.
In
the
same
way
,
a
knife
which
has
to
cut
all
sorts
of
things
may
be
of
almost
any
shape
;
whilst
a
tool
for
some
particular
purpose
must
be
of
some
particular
shape
.
Natural
selection
,
it
should
never
be
forgotten
,
can
act
solely
through
and
for
the
advantage
of
each
being
.
Rudimentary
parts
,
as
it
is
generally
admitted
,
are
apt
to
be
highly
variable
.
We
shall
have
to
recur
to
this
subject
;
and
I
will
here
only
add
that
their
variability
seems
to
result
from
their
uselessness
,
and
consequently
from
natural
selection
having
had
no
power
to
check
deviations
in
their
structure
.
A
Part
developed
in
any
Species
in
an
extraordinary
degree
or
manner
,
in
comparison
with
the
same
Part
in
allied
Species
,
tends
to
be
highly
variable
Several
years
ago
I
was
much
struck
by
a
remark
,
to
the
above
effect
,
made
by
Mr
.
Waterhouse
.
Professor
Owen
,
also
,
seems
to
have
come
to
a
nearly
similar
conclusion
.
It
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
convince
any
one
of
the
truth
of
the
above
proposition
without
giving
the
long
array
of
facts
which
I
have
collected
,
and
which
cannot
possibly
be
here
introduced
.
I
can
only
state
my
conviction
that
it
is
a
rule
of
high
generality
.
I
am
aware
of
several
causes
of
error
,
but
I
hope
that
I
have
made
due
allowance
for
them
.
It
should
be
understood
that
the
rule
by
no
means
applies
to
any
part
,
however
unusually
developed
,
unless
it
be
unusually
developed
in
one
species
or
in
a
few
species
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
many
closely
allied
species
.
Thus
,
the
wing
of
a
bat
is
a
most
abnormal
structure
in
the
class
of
mammals
,
but
the
rule
would
not
apply
here
,
because
the
whole
group
of
bats
possesses
wings
;
it
would
apply
only
if
some
one
species
had
wings
developed
in
a
remarkable
manner
in
comparison
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
.
The
rule
applies
very
strongly
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
,
when
displayed
in
any
unusual
manner
.
The
term
,
secondary
sexual
characters
,
used
by
Hunter
,
relates
to
characters
which
are
attached
to
one
sex
,
but
are
not
directly
connected
with
the
act
of
reproduction
.
The
rule
applies
to
males
and
females
;
but
more
rarely
to
the
females
,
as
they
seldom
offer
remarkable
secondary
sexual
characters
.
The
rule
being
so
plainly
applicable
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
,
may
be
due
to
the
great
variability
of
these
characters
,
whether
or
not
displayed
in
any
unusual
manner
of
which
fact
I
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
.
But
that
our
rule
is
not
confined
to
secondary
sexual
characters
is
clearly
shown
in
the
case
of
hermaphrodite
cirripedes
;
I
particularly
attended
to
Mr
.
Waterhouse's
remark
,
whilst
investigating
this
Order
,
and
I
am
fully
convinced
that
the
rule
almost
always
holds
good
.
I
shall
,
in
a
future
work
,
give
a
list
of
all
the
more
remarkable
cases
;
I
will
here
give
only
one
,
as
it
illustrates
the
rule
in
its
largest
application
.
The
opereular
valves
of
sessile
cirripedes
(
rock
barnacles
)
are
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
very
important
structures
,
and
they
differ
extremely
little
even
in
distinct
genera
;
but
in
the
several
species
of
one
genus
,
Pyrgoma
,
these
valves
present
a
marvelous
amount
of
diversification
;
the
homologous
valves
in
the
different
species
being
sometimes
wholly
unlike
in
shape
;
and
the
amount
of
variation
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
is
so
great
,
that
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
differ
more
from
each
other
in
the
characters
derived
from
these
important
organs
,
than
do
the
species
belonging
to
other
distinct
genera
.
As
with
birds
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
inhabiting
the
same
country
,
vary
extremely
little
,
I
have
particularly
attended
to
them
;
and
the
rule
certainly
seems
to
hold
good
in
this
class
.
I
cannot
make
out
that
it
applies
to
plants
,
and
this
would
have
seriously
shaken
my
belief
in
its
truth
,
had
not
the
great
variability
in
plants
made
it
particularly
difficult
to
compare
their
relative
degrees
of
variability
.
When
we
see
any
part
or
organ
developed
in
a
remarkable
degree
or
manner
in
a
species
,
the
fair
presumption
is
that
it
is
of
high
importance
to
that
species
:
nevertheless
it
is
in
this
case
eminently
liable
to
variation
.
Why
should
this
be
so
?
On
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
,
with
all
its
parts
as
we
now
see
them
,
I
can
see
no
explanation
.
But
on
the
view
that
groups
of
species
are
descended
from
some
other
species
,
and
have
been
modified
through
natural
selection
,
I
think
we
can
obtain
some
light
.
First
let
me
make
some
preliminary
remarks
.
If
,
in
our
domestic
animals
,
any
part
or
the
whole
animal
be
neglected
,
and
no
selection
be
applied
,
that
part
(
for
instance
,
the
comb
in
the
Dorking
fowl
)
or
the
whole
breed
will
cease
to
have
a
uniform
character
:
and
the
breed
may
be
said
to
be
degenerating
.
In
rudimentary
organs
,
and
in
those
which
have
been
but
little
specialised
for
any
particular
purpose
,
and
perhaps
in
polymorphic
groups
,
we
see
a
nearly
parallel
case
;
for
in
such
cases
natural
selection
either
has
not
or
cannot
have
come
into
full
play
,
and
thus
the
organisation
is
left
in
a
fluctuating
condition
.
But
what
here
more
particularly
concerns
us
is
,
that
those
points
in
our
domestic
animals
,
which
at
the
present
time
are
undergoing
rapid
change
by
continued
selection
,
are
also
eminently
liable
to
variation
.
Look
at
the
individuals
of
the
same
breed
of
the
pigeon
,
and
see
what
a
prodigious
amount
of
difference
there
is
in
the
beaks
of
tumblers
,
in
the
beaks
and
wattle
of
carriers
,
in
the
carriage
and
tail
of
fantails
,
&c
.
,
these
being
the
points
now
mainly
attended
to
by
English
fanciers
.
Even
in
the
same
sub
breed
,
as
in
that
of
the
short
faced
tumbler
,
it
is
notoriously
difficult
to
breed
nearly
perfect
birds
,
many
departing
widely
from
the
standard
.
There
may
truly
be
said
to
be
a
constant
struggle
going
on
between
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
tendency
to
reversion
to
a
less
perfect
state
,
as
well
as
an
innate
tendency
to
new
variations
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
power
of
steady
selection
to
keep
the
breed
true
.
In
the
long
run
selection
gains
the
day
,
and
we
do
not
expect
to
fail
so
completely
as
to
breed
a
bird
as
coarse
as
a
common
tumbler
pigeon
from
a
good
short
faced
strain
.
But
as
long
as
selection
is
rapidly
going
on
,
much
variability
in
the
parts
undergoing
modification
may
always
be
expected
.
Now
let
us
turn
to
nature
.
When
a
part
has
been
developed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
any
one
species
,
compared
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
,
we
may
conclude
that
this
part
has
undergone
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
since
the
period
when
the
several
species
branched
off
from
the
common
progenitor
of
the
genus
.
This
period
will
seldom
be
remote
in
any
extreme
degree
,
as
species
rarely
endure
for
more
than
one
geological
period
.
An
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
implies
an
unusually
large
and
long
continued
amount
of
variability
,
which
has
continually
been
accumulated
by
natural
selection
for
the
benefit
of
the
species
.
But
as
the
variability
of
the
extraordinarily
developed
part
or
organ
has
been
so
great
and
long
continued
within
a
period
not
excessively
remote
,
we
might
,
as
a
general
rule
,
still
expect
to
find
more
variability
in
such
parts
than
in
other
parts
of
the
organisation
which
have
remained
for
a
much
longer
period
nearly
constant
.
And
this
,
I
am
convinced
,
is
the
case
.
That
the
struggle
between
natural
selection
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
tendency
to
reversion
and
variability
on
the
other
hand
,
will
in
the
course
of
time
cease
;
and
that
the
most
abnormally
developed
organs
may
be
made
constant
,
I
see
no
reason
to
doubt
.
Hence
,
when
an
organ
,
however
abnormal
it
may
be
,
has
been
transmitted
in
approximately
the
same
condition
to
many
modified
descendants
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
wing
of
the
bat
,
it
must
have
existed
,
according
to
our
theory
,
for
an
immense
period
in
nearly
the
same
state
;
and
thus
it
has
come
not
to
be
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
.
It
is
only
in
those
cases
in
which
the
modification
has
been
comparatively
recent
and
extraordinarily
great
that
we
ought
to
find
the
generative
variability
,
as
it
may
be
called
,
still
present
in
a
high
degree
.
For
in
this
case
the
variability
will
seldom
as
yet
have
been
fixed
by
the
continued
selection
of
the
individuals
varying
in
the
required
manner
and
degree
,
and
by
the
continued
rejection
of
those
tending
to
revert
to
a
former
and
less
modified
condition
.
Specific
Characters
more
Variable
than
Generic
Characters
The
principle
discussed
under
the
last
heading
may
be
applied
to
our
present
subject
.
It
is
notorious
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
.
To
explain
by
a
simple
example
what
is
meant
:
if
in
a
large
genus
of
plants
some
species
had
blue
flowers
and
some
had
red
,
the
colour
would
be
only
a
specific
character
,
and
no
one
would
be
surprised
at
one
of
the
blue
species
varying
into
red
,
or
conversely
;
but
if
all
the
species
had
blue
flowers
,
the
colour
would
become
a
generic
character
,
and
its
variation
would
be
a
more
unusual
circumstance
.
I
have
chosen
this
example
because
the
explanation
which
most
naturalists
would
advance
is
not
here
applicable
,
namely
,
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
,
because
they
are
taken
from
parts
of
less
physiological
importance
than
those
commonly
used
for
classing
genera
.
I
believe
this
explanation
is
partly
,
yet
only
indirectly
,
true
;
I
shall
,
however
,
have
to
return
to
this
point
in
the
chapter
on
Classification
.
It
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
adduce
evidence
in
support
of
the
statement
,
that
ordinary
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
;
but
with
respect
to
important
characters
I
have
repeatedly
noticed
in
works
on
natural
history
,
that
when
an
author
remarks
with
surprise
that
some
important
organ
or
part
,
which
is
generally
very
constant
throughout
a
large
group
of
species
,
differs
considerably
in
closely
allied
species
,
it
is
often
variable
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
.
And
this
fact
shows
that
a
character
,
which
is
generally
of
generic
value
,
when
it
sinks
in
value
and
becomes
only
of
specific
value
,
often
becomes
variable
,
though
its
physiological
importance
may
remain
the
same
.
Something
of
the
same
kind
applies
to
monstrosities
:
at
least
Isidore
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire
apparently
entertains
no
doubt
that
the
more
an
organ
normally
differs
in
the
different
species
of
the
same
group
,
the
more
subject
it
is
to
anomalies
in
the
individuals
.
On
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
,
why
should
that
part
of
the
structure
,
which
differs
from
the
same
part
in
other
independently
created
species
of
the
same
genus
,
be
more
variable
than
those
parts
which
are
closely
alike
in
the
several
species
?
I
do
not
see
that
any
explanation
can
be
given
.
But
on
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
fixed
varieties
,
we
might
expect
often
to
find
them
still
continuing
to
vary
in
those
parts
of
their
structure
which
have
varied
within
a
moderately
recent
period
,
and
which
have
thus
come
to
differ
.
Or
to
state
the
case
in
another
manner
:
the
points
in
which
all
the
species
of
a
genus
resemble
each
other
,
and
in
which
they
differ
from
allied
genera
,
are
called
generic
characters
;
and
these
characters
may
be
attributed
to
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
,
for
it
can
rarely
have
happened
that
natural
selection
will
have
modified
several
distinct
species
,
fitted
to
more
or
less
widely
different
habits
,
in
exactly
the
same
manner
:
and
as
these
so
called
generic
characters
have
been
inherited
from
before
the
period
when
the
several
species
first
branched
off
from
their
common
progenitor
,
and
subsequently
have
not
varied
or
come
to
differ
in
any
degree
,
or
only
in
a
slight
degree
,
it
is
not
probable
that
they
should
vary
at
the
present
day
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
points
in
which
species
differ
from
other
species
of
the
same
genus
are
called
specific
characters
;
and
as
these
specific
characters
have
varied
and
come
to
differ
since
the
period
when
the
species
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
,
it
is
probable
that
they
should
still
often
be
in
some
degree
variable
,
at
least
more
variable
than
those
parts
of
the
organisation
which
have
for
a
very
long
period
remained
constant
.
Secondary
Sexual
Characters
Variable
.
I
think
it
will
be
admitted
by
naturalists
,
without
my
entering
on
details
,
that
secondary
sexual
characters
are
highly
variable
.
It
will
also
be
admitted
that
species
of
the
same
group
differ
from
each
other
more
widely
in
their
secondary
sexual
characters
,
than
in
other
parts
of
their
organisation
:
compare
,
for
instance
,
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
males
of
gallinaceous
birds
,
in
which
secondary
sexual
characters
are
strongly
displayed
,
with
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
females
.
The
cause
of
the
original
variability
of
these
characters
is
not
manifest
;
but
we
can
see
why
they
should
not
have
been
rendered
as
constant
and
uniform
as
others
,
for
they
are
accumulated
by
sexual
selection
,
which
is
less
rigid
in
its
action
than
ordinary
selection
,
as
it
does
not
entail
death
,
but
only
gives
fewer
off
spring
to
the
less
favoured
males
.
Whatever
the
cause
may
be
of
the
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
,
as
they
are
highly
variable
,
sexual
selection
will
have
had
a
wide
scope
for
action
,
and
may
thus
have
succeeded
in
giving
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
a
greater
amount
of
difference
in
these
than
in
other
respects
.
It
is
a
remarkable
fact
,
that
the
secondary
differences
between
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
are
generally
displayed
in
the
very
same
parts
of
the
organisation
in
which
the
species
of
the
same
genus
differ
from
each
other
.
Of
this
fact
I
will
give
in
illustration
the
two
first
instances
which
happen
to
stand
on
my
list
;
and
as
the
differences
in
these
cases
are
of
a
very
unusual
nature
,
the
relation
can
hardly
be
accidental
.
The
same
number
of
joints
in
the
tarsi
is
a
character
common
to
very
large
groups
of
beetles
,
but
in
the
Engidoe
,
as
Westwood
has
remarked
,
the
number
varies
greatly
;
and
the
number
likewise
differs
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
.
Again
in
the
fossorial
hymenoptera
,
the
neuration
of
the
wings
is
a
character
of
the
highest
importance
,
because
common
to
large
groups
;
but
in
certain
genera
the
neuration
differs
in
the
different
species
,
and
likewise
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
.
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
has
recently
remarked
,
that
several
minute
crustaceans
offer
excellent
illustrations
of
this
law
.
"
In
Pontella
,
for
instance
,
the
sexual
characters
are
afforded
mainly
by
the
anterior
antennae
and
by
the
fifth
pair
of
legs
:
the
specific
differences
also
are
principally
given
by
these
organs
.
"
This
relation
has
a
clear
meaning
on
my
view
:
I
look
at
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
as
having
as
certainly
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
,
as
have
the
two
sexes
of
any
one
species
.
Consequently
,
whatever
part
of
the
structure
of
the
common
progenitor
,
or
of
its
early
descendants
,
became
variable
,
variations
of
this
part
would
,
it
is
highly
probable
,
be
taken
advantage
of
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
,
in
order
to
fit
the
several
species
to
their
several
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
and
likewise
to
fit
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
to
each
other
,
or
to
fit
the
males
to
struggle
with
other
males
for
the
possession
of
the
females
.
Finally
,
then
,
I
conclude
that
the
greater
variability
of
specific
characters
,
or
those
which
distinguish
species
from
species
,
than
of
generic
characters
,
or
those
which
are
possessed
by
all
the
species
;
that
the
frequent
extreme
variability
of
any
part
which
is
developed
in
a
species
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
its
congeners
;
and
the
slight
degree
of
variability
in
a
part
,
however
extraordinarily
it
may
be
developed
,
if
it
be
common
to
a
whole
group
of
species
;
that
the
great
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
,
and
their
great
difference
in
closely
allied
species
;
that
secondary
sexual
and
ordinary
specific
differences
are
generally
displayed
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation
,
are
all
principles
closely
connected
together
.
All
being
mainly
due
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
being
the
descendants
of
common
progenitor
,
from
whom
they
have
inherited
much
in
common
,
to
parts
which
have
recently
and
largely
varied
being
more
likely
still
to
go
on
varying
than
parts
which
have
long
been
inherited
and
have
not
varied
,
to
natural
selection
having
more
or
less
completely
,
according
to
the
lapse
of
time
,
overmastered
the
tendency
to
reversion
and
to
further
variability
,
to
sexual
selection
being
less
rigid
than
ordinary
selection
,
and
to
variations
in
the
same
parts
having
been
accumulated
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
,
and
having
been
thus
adapted
for
secondary
sexual
,
and
for
ordinary
purposes
.
Distinct
Species
present
analagous
Variations
,
so
that
a
Variety
of
one
Species
often
assumes
a
Character
proper
to
an
Allied
Species
,
or
reverts
to
some
of
the
Characters
of
an
early
Progenitor
.
These
propositions
will
be
most
readily
understood
by
looking
to
our
domestic
races
.
The
most
distinct
breeds
of
the
pigeon
,
in
countries
widely
apart
,
present
sub
varieties
with
reversed
feathers
on
the
head
,
and
with
feathers
on
the
feet
,
characters
not
possessed
by
the
aboriginal
rock
pigeon
;
these
then
are
analogous
variations
in
two
or
more
distinct
races
.
The
frequent
presence
of
fourteen
or
even
sixteen
tail
feathers
in
the
pouter
may
be
considered
as
a
variation
representing
the
normal
structure
of
another
race
,
the
fan
tail
.
I
presume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
all
such
analogous
variations
are
due
to
the
several
races
of
the
pigeon
having
inherited
from
a
common
parent
the
same
constitution
and
tendency
to
variation
,
when
acted
on
by
similar
unknown
influences
.
In
the
vegetable
kingdom
we
have
a
case
of
analogous
variation
,
in
the
enlarged
stems
,
or
as
commonly
called
roots
,
of
the
Swedish
turnip
and
Rutabaga
,
plants
which
several
botanists
rank
as
varieties
produced
by
cultivation
from
a
common
parent
:
if
this
be
not
so
,
the
case
will
then
be
one
of
analogous
variation
in
two
so
called
distinct
species
;
and
to
these
a
third
may
be
added
,
namely
,
the
common
turnip
.
According
to
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
,
we
should
have
to
attribute
this
similarity
in
the
enlarged
stems
of
these
three
plants
,
not
to
the
vera
causa
of
community
of
descent
,
and
a
consequent
tendency
to
vary
in
a
like
manner
,
but
to
three
separate
yet
closely
related
acts
of
creation
.
Many
similar
cases
of
analogous
variation
have
been
observed
by
Naudin
in
the
great
gourd
family
,
and
by
various
authors
in
our
cereals
.
Similar
cases
occurring
with
insects
under
natural
conditions
have
lately
been
discussed
with
much
ability
by
Mr
.
Walsh
,
who
has
grouped
them
under
his
law
of
Equable
Variability
.
With
pigeons
,
however
,
we
have
another
case
,
namely
,
the
occasional
appearance
in
all
the
breeds
,
of
slaty
blue
birds
with
two
black
bars
on
the
wings
,
white
loins
,
a
bar
at
the
end
of
the
tail
,
with
the
outer
feathers
externally
edged
near
their
basis
with
white
.
As
all
these
marks
are
characteristic
of
the
parent
rock
pigeon
,
I
presume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
this
is
a
case
of
reversion
,
and
not
of
a
new
yet
analogous
variation
appearing
in
the
several
breeds
.
We
may
,
I
think
,
confidently
come
to
this
conclusion
,
because
,
as
we
have
seen
,
these
coloured
marks
are
eminently
liable
to
appear
in
the
crossed
offspring
of
two
distinct
and
differently
coloured
breeds
;
and
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
in
the
external
conditions
of
life
to
cause
the
reappearance
of
the
slaty
blue
,
with
the
several
marks
,
beyond
the
influence
of
the
mere
act
of
crossing
on
the
laws
of
inheritance
.
No
doubt
it
is
a
very
surprising
fact
that
characters
should
reappear
after
having
been
lost
for
many
,
probably
for
hundreds
of
generations
.
But
when
a
breed
has
been
crossed
only
once
by
some
other
breed
,
the
offspring
occasionally
show
for
many
generations
a
tendency
to
revert
in
character
to
the
foreign
breed
some
say
,
for
a
dozen
or
even
a
score
of
generations
.
After
twelve
generations
,
the
proportion
of
blood
,
to
use
a
common
expression
,
from
one
ancestor
,
is
only
1
in
2048
;
and
yet
,
as
we
see
,
it
is
generally
believed
that
a
tendency
to
reversion
is
retained
by
this
remnant
of
foreign
blood
.
In
a
breed
which
has
not
been
crossed
,
but
in
which
both
parents
have
lost
some
character
which
their
progenitor
possessed
,
the
tendency
,
whether
strong
or
weak
,
to
reproduce
the
lost
character
might
,
as
was
formerly
remarked
,
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
contrary
,
be
transmitted
for
almost
any
number
of
generations
.
When
a
character
which
has
been
lost
in
a
breed
,
reappears
after
a
great
number
of
generations
,
the
most
probable
hypothesis
is
,
not
that
one
individual
suddenly
takes
after
an
ancestor
removed
by
some
hundred
generations
,
but
that
in
each
successive
generation
the
character
in
question
has
been
lying
latent
,
and
at
last
,
under
unknown
favourable
conditions
,
is
developed
.
With
the
barb
pigeon
,
for
instance
,
which
very
rarely
produces
a
blue
bird
,
it
is
probable
that
there
is
a
latent
tendency
in
each
generation
to
produce
blue
plumage
.
The
abstract
improbability
of
such
a
tendency
being
transmitted
through
a
vast
number
of
generations
,
is
not
greater
than
that
of
quite
useless
or
rudimentary
organs
being
similarly
transmitted
.
A
mere
tendency
to
produce
a
rudiment
is
indeed
sometimes
thus
inherited
.
As
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
are
supposed
to
be
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
,
it
might
be
expected
that
they
would
occasionally
vary
in
an
analogous
manner
;
so
that
the
varieties
of
two
or
more
species
would
resemble
each
other
,
or
that
a
variety
of
one
species
would
resemble
in
certain
characters
another
and
distinct
species
,
this
other
species
being
,
according
to
our
view
,
only
a
well
marked
and
permanent
variety
.
But
characters
exclusively
due
to
analogous
variation
would
probably
be
of
an
unimportant
nature
,
for
the
preservation
of
all
functionally
important
characters
will
have
been
determined
through
natural
selection
,
in
accordance
with
the
different
habits
of
the
species
.
It
might
further
be
expected
that
the
species
of
the
same
genus
would
occasionally
exhibit
reversions
to
long
lost
characters
.
As
,
however
,
we
do
not
know
the
common
ancestors
of
any
natural
group
,
we
cannot
distinguish
between
reversionary
and
analogous
characters
.
If
,
for
instance
,
we
did
not
know
that
the
parent
rock
pigeon
was
not
feather
footed
or
turn
crowned
,
we
could
not
have
told
,
whether
such
characters
in
our
domestic
breeds
were
reversions
or
only
analogous
variations
;
but
we
might
have
inferred
that
the
blue
colour
was
a
case
of
reversion
from
the
number
of
the
markings
,
which
are
correlated
with
this
tint
,
and
which
would
not
probably
have
all
appeared
together
from
simple
variation
.
More
especially
we
might
have
inferred
this
,
from
the
blue
colour
and
the
several
marks
so
often
appearing
when
differently
coloured
breeds
are
crossed
.
Hence
,
although
under
nature
it
must
generally
be
left
doubtful
,
what
cases
are
reversions
to
formerly
existing
characters
,
and
what
are
new
but
analogous
variations
,
yet
we
ought
,
on
our
theory
,
sometimes
to
find
the
varying
offspring
of
a
species
assuming
characters
which
are
already
present
in
other
members
of
the
same
group
.
And
this
undoubtedly
is
the
case
.
The
difficulty
in
distinguishing
variable
species
is
largely
due
to
the
varieties
mocking
,
as
it
were
,
other
species
of
the
same
genus
.
A
considerable
catalogue
,
also
,
could
be
given
of
forms
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
,
which
themselves
can
only
doubtfully
be
ranked
as
species
;
and
this
shows
,
unless
all
these
closely
allied
forms
be
considered
as
independently
created
species
,
that
they
have
in
varying
assumed
some
of
the
characters
of
the
others
.
But
the
best
evidence
of
analogous
variations
is
afforded
by
parts
or
organs
which
are
generally
constant
in
character
,
but
which
occasionally
vary
so
as
to
resemble
,
in
some
degree
,
the
same
part
or
organ
in
an
allied
species
.
I
have
collected
a
long
list
of
such
cases
;
but
here
,
as
before
,
I
lie
under
the
great
disadvantage
of
not
being
able
to
give
them
.
I
can
only
repeat
that
such
cases
certainly
occur
,
and
seem
to
me
very
remarkable
.
I
will
,
however
,
give
one
curious
and
complex
case
,
not
indeed
as
affecting
any
important
character
,
but
from
occurring
in
several
species
of
the
same
genus
,
partly
under
domestication
and
partly
under
nature
.
It
is
a
case
almost
certainly
of
reversion
.
The
ass
sometimes
has
very
distinct
transverse
bars
on
its
legs
,
like
those
on
the
legs
of
the
zebra
:
it
has
been
asserted
that
these
are
plainest
in
the
foal
,
and
,
from
inquiries
which
I
have
made
,
I
believe
this
to
be
true
.
The
stripe
on
the
shoulder
is
sometimes
double
,
and
is
very
variable
in
length
and
outline
.
A
white
ass
,
but
not
an
albino
,
has
been
described
without
either
spinal
or
shoulder
stripe
:
and
these
stripes
are
sometimes
very
obscure
,
or
actually
quite
lost
,
in
dark
coloured
asses
.
The
koulan
of
Pallas
is
said
to
have
been
seen
with
a
double
shoulder
stripe
.
Mr
.
Blyth
has
seen
a
specimen
of
the
hemionus
with
a
distinct
shoulder
stripe
,
though
it
properly
has
none
;
and
I
have
been
informed
by
Colonel
Poole
that
the
foals
of
this
species
are
generally
striped
on
the
legs
,
and
faintly
on
the
shoulder
.
The
quagga
,
though
so
plainly
barred
like
a
zebra
over
the
body
,
is
without
bars
on
the
legs
;
but
Dr
.
Gray
has
figured
one
specimen
with
very
distinct
zebra
like
bars
on
the
hocks
.
With
respect
to
the
horse
,
I
have
collected
cases
in
England
of
the
spinal
stripe
in
horses
of
the
most
distinct
breeds
,
and
of
all
colours
:
transverse
bars
on
the
legs
are
not
rare
in
duns
,
mouse
duns
,
and
in
one
instance
in
a
chestnut
a
faint
shoulder
stripe
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
duns
,
and
I
have
seen
a
trace
in
a
bay
horse
.
My
son
made
a
careful
examination
and
sketch
for
me
of
a
dun
Belgian
cart
horse
with
a
double
stripe
on
each
shoulder
and
with
leg
stripes
;
I
have
myself
seen
a
dun
Devonshire
pony
,
and
a
small
dun
Welsh
pony
has
been
carefully
described
to
me
,
both
with
three
parallel
stripes
on
each
shoulder
.
In
the
north
west
part
of
India
the
kattywar
breed
of
horses
is
so
generally
striped
,
that
,
as
I
hear
from
Colonel
Poole
,
who
examined
this
breed
for
the
Indian
Government
,
a
horse
without
stripes
is
not
considered
as
purely
bred
.
The
spine
is
always
striped
;
the
legs
are
generally
barred
;
and
the
shoulder
stripe
,
which
is
sometimes
double
and
sometimes
treble
,
is
common
;
the
side
of
the
face
,
moreover
,
is
sometimes
striped
.
The
stripes
are
often
plainest
in
the
foal
;
and
sometimes
quite
disappear
in
old
horses
.
Colonel
Poole
has
seen
both
gray
and
bay
kattywar
horses
striped
when
first
foaled
.
I
have
also
reason
to
suspect
,
from
information
given
me
by
Mr
.
W
.
W
.
Edwards
,
that
with
the
English
race
horse
the
spinal
stripe
is
much
commoner
in
the
foal
than
in
the
fullgrown
animal
.
I
have
myself
recently
bred
a
foal
from
a
bay
mare
(
offspring
of
a
Turkoman
horse
and
a
Flemish
mare
)
by
a
bay
English
race
horse
;
this
foal
when
a
week
old
was
marked
on
its
hinder
quarters
and
on
its
forehead
with
numerous
,
very
narrow
,
dark
,
zebra
like
bars
,
and
its
legs
were
feebly
striped
:
all
the
stripes
soon
disappeared
completely
.
Without
here
entering
on
further
details
,
I
may
state
that
I
have
collected
cases
of
leg
and
shoulder
stripes
in
horses
of
very
different
breeds
in
various
countries
from
Britain
to
eastern
China
;
and
from
Norway
in
the
north
to
the
Malay
Archipelago
in
the
south
.
In
all
parts
of
the
world
these
stripes
occur
far
oftenest
in
duns
and
mouse
duns
;
by
the
term
dun
a
large
range
of
colour
is
included
,
from
one
between
brown
and
black
to
a
close
approach
to
cream
colour
.
I
am
aware
that
Colonel
Hamilton
Smith
,
who
has
written
on
this
subject
,
believes
that
the
several
breeds
of
the
horse
are
descended
from
several
aboriginal
species
one
of
which
,
the
dun
,
was
striped
;
and
that
the
above
described
appearances
are
an
due
to
ancient
crosses
with
the
dun
stock
.
But
this
view
may
be
safely
rejected
;
for
it
is
highly
improbable
that
the
heavy
Belgian
cart
horse
,
Welsh
ponies
,
Norwegian
cobs
,
the
lanky
kattywar
race
,
&c
.
,
inhabiting
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
world
,
should
all
have
been
crossed
with
one
supposed
aboriginal
stock
.
Now
let
us
turn
to
the
effects
of
crossing
the
several
species
of
the
horse
genus
.
Rollin
asserts
,
that
the
common
mule
from
the
ass
and
horse
is
particularly
apt
to
have
bars
on
its
legs
;
according
to
Mr
.
Gosse
,
in
certain
parts
of
the
United
States
about
nine
out
of
ten
mules
have
striped
legs
.
I
once
saw
a
mule
with
its
legs
so
much
striped
that
any
one
might
have
thought
that
it
was
a
hybrid
zebra
;
and
Mr
.
W
.
C
.
Martin
,
in
his
excellent
treatise
on
the
horse
,
has
given
a
figure
of
a
similar
mule
.
In
four
coloured
drawings
,
which
I
have
seen
,
of
hybrids
between
the
ass
and
zebra
,
the
legs
were
much
more
plainly
barred
than
the
rest
of
the
body
;
and
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
double
shoulder
stripe
.
In
Lord
Morton's
famous
hybrid
,
from
a
chestnut
mare
and
male
quagga
,
the
hybrid
,
and
even
the
pure
offspring
subsequently
produced
from
the
same
mare
by
a
black
Arabian
sire
,
were
much
more
plainly
barred
across
the
legs
than
is
even
the
pure
quagga
.
Lastly
,
and
this
is
another
most
remarkable
case
,
a
hybrid
has
been
figured
by
Dr
.
Gray
(
and
he
informs
me
that
he
knows
of
a
second
case
)
from
the
ass
and
the
hemionus
;
and
this
hybrid
,
though
the
ass
only
occasionally
has
stripes
on
its
legs
and
the
hemionus
has
none
and
has
not
even
a
shoulder
stripe
,
nevertheless
had
all
four
legs
barred
,
and
had
three
short
shoulder
stripes
,
like
those
on
the
dun
Devonshire
and
Welsh
ponies
,
and
even
had
some
zebra
like
stripes
on
the
sides
of
its
face
.
With
respect
to
this
last
fact
,
I
was
so
convinced
that
not
even
a
stripe
of
colour
appears
from
what
is
commonly
called
chance
,
that
I
was
led
solely
from
the
occurrence
of
the
face
stripes
on
this
hybrid
from
the
ass
and
hemionus
to
ask
Colonel
Poole
whether
such
face
stripes
ever
occurred
in
the
eminently
striped
kattywar
breed
of
horses
,
and
was
,
as
we
have
seen
,
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
What
now
are
we
to
say
to
these
several
facts
?
We
see
several
distinct
species
of
the
horse
genus
becoming
,
by
simple
variation
,
striped
on
the
legs
like
a
zebra
,
or
striped
on
the
shoulders
like
an
ass
.
In
the
horse
we
see
this
tendency
strong
whenever
a
dun
tint
appears
a
tint
which
approaches
to
that
of
the
general
colouring
of
the
other
species
of
the
genus
.
The
appearance
of
the
stripes
is
not
accompanied
by
any
change
of
form
or
by
any
other
new
character
.
We
see
this
tendency
to
become
striped
most
strongly
displayed
in
hybrids
from
between
several
of
the
most
distinct
species
.
Now
observe
the
case
of
the
several
breeds
of
pigeons
:
they
are
descended
from
a
pigeon
(
including
two
or
three
sub
species
or
geographical
races
)
of
bluish
colour
,
with
certain
bars
and
other
marks
;
and
when
any
breed
assumes
by
simple
variation
a
bluish
tint
,
these
bars
and
other
marks
invariably
reappear
;
but
without
any
other
change
of
form
or
character
.
When
the
oldest
and
truest
breeds
of
various
colours
are
crossed
,
we
see
a
strong
tendency
for
the
blue
tint
and
bars
and
marks
to
reappear
in
the
mongrels
.
I
have
stated
that
the
most
probable
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
reappearance
of
very
ancient
characters
,
is
that
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
young
of
each
successive
generation
to
produce
the
long
lost
character
,
and
that
this
tendency
,
from
unknown
causes
,
sometimes
prevails
.
And
we
have
just
seen
that
in
several
species
of
the
horse
genus
the
stripes
are
either
plainer
or
appear
more
commonly
in
the
young
than
in
the
old
.
Call
the
breeds
of
pigeons
,
some
of
which
have
bred
true
for
centuries
,
species
;
and
how
exactly
parallel
is
the
case
with
that
of
the
species
of
the
horse
genus!
For
myself
,
I
venture
confidently
to
look
back
thousands
on
thousands
of
generations
,
and
I
see
an
animal
striped
like
a
zebra
,
but
perhaps
otherwise
very
differently
constructed
,
the
common
parent
of
our
domestic
horse
(
whether
or
not
it
be
descended
from
one
or
more
wild
stocks
)
,
of
the
ass
,
the
hemionus
,
quagga
,
and
zebra
.
He
who
believes
that
each
equine
species
was
independently
created
,
will
,
I
presume
,
assert
that
each
species
has
been
created
with
a
tendency
to
vary
,
both
under
nature
and
under
domestication
,
in
this
particular
manner
,
so
as
often
to
become
striped
like
the
other
species
of
the
genus
;
and
that
each
has
been
created
with
a
strong
tendency
,
when
crossed
with
species
inhabiting
distant
quarters
of
the
world
,
to
produce
hybrids
resembling
in
their
stripes
,
not
their
own
parents
,
but
other
species
of
the
genus
.
To
admit
this
view
is
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
to
reject
a
real
for
an
unreal
,
or
at
least
for
an
unknown
,
cause
.
It
makes
the
works
of
God
a
mere
mockery
and
deception
;
I
would
almost
as
soon
believe
,
with
the
old
and
ignorant
cosmogonists
,
that
fossil
shells
had
never
lived
,
but
had
been
created
in
stone
so
as
to
mock
the
shells
living
on
the
seashore
.
Summary
.
Our
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
variation
is
profound
.
Not
in
one
case
out
of
a
hundred
can
we
pretend
to
assign
any
reason
why
this
or
that
part
has
varied
.
But
whenever
we
have
the
means
of
instituting
a
comparison
,
the
same
laws
appear
to
have
acted
in
producing
the
lesser
differences
between
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
and
the
greater
differences
between
species
of
the
same
genus
.
Changed
conditions
generally
induce
mere
fluctuating
variability
,
but
sometimes
they
cause
direct
and
definite
effects
;
and
these
may
become
strongly
marked
in
the
course
of
time
,
though
we
have
not
sufficient
evidence
on
this
head
.
Habit
in
producing
constitutional
peculiarities
and
use
in
strengthening
and
disuse
in
weakening
and
diminishing
organs
,
appear
in
many
cases
to
have
been
potent
in
their
effects
.
Homologous
parts
tend
to
vary
in
the
same
manner
,
and
homologous
parts
tend
to
cohere
.
Modifications
in
hard
parts
and
in
external
parts
sometimes
affect
softer
and
internal
parts
.
When
one
part
is
largely
developed
,
perhaps
it
tends
to
draw
nourishment
from
the
adjoining
parts
;
and
every
part
of
the
structure
which
can
be
saved
without
detriment
will
be
saved
.
Changes
of
structure
at
an
early
age
may
affect
parts
subsequently
developed
;
and
many
cases
of
correlated
variation
,
the
nature
of
which
we
are
unable
to
understand
,
undoubtedly
occur
.
Multiple
parts
are
variable
in
number
and
in
structure
,
perhaps
arising
from
such
parts
not
having
been
closely
specialised
for
any
particular
function
,
so
that
their
modifications
have
not
been
closely
cheeked
by
natural
selection
.
It
follows
probably
from
this
same
cause
,
that
organic
beings
low
in
the
scale
are
more
variable
than
those
standing
higher
in
the
scale
,
and
which
have
their
whole
organisation
more
specialised
.
Rudimentary
organs
,
from
being
useless
,
are
not
regulated
by
natural
selection
,
and
hence
are
variable
.
Specific
characters
that
is
,
the
characters
which
have
,
come
to
differ
since
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
branched
off
from
a
common
parent
are
more
variable
than
generic
characters
,
or
those
which
have
long
been
inherited
,
and
have
not
differed
from
this
same
period
.
In
these
remarks
we
have
referred
to
special
parts
or
organs
being
still
variable
,
because
they
have
recently
varied
and
thus
come
to
differ
;
but
we
have
also
seen
in
the
second
chapter
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
the
whole
individual
;
for
in
a
district
where
many
species
of
a
genus
are
found
that
is
,
where
there
has
been
much
former
variation
and
differentiation
,
or
where
the
manufactory
of
new
specific
forms
has
been
actively
at
work
in
that
district
and
amongst
these
species
,
we
now
find
,
on
an
average
,
most
varieties
.
Secondary
sexual
characters
are
highly
variable
,
and
such
characters
differ
much
in
the
species
of
the
same
group
.
Variability
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation
has
generally
been
taken
advantage
of
in
giving
secondary
sexual
differences
to
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
,
and
specific
differences
to
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
.
Any
part
or
organ
developed
to
an
extraordinary
size
or
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
or
organ
in
the
allied
species
,
must
have
gone
through
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
since
the
genus
arose
;
and
thus
we
can
understand
why
it
should
often
still
be
variable
in
a
much
higher
degree
than
other
parts
;
for
variation
is
a
long
continued
and
slow
process
,
and
natural
selection
will
in
such
cases
not
as
yet
have
had
time
to
overcome
the
tendency
to
further
variability
and
to
reversion
to
a
less
modified
state
.
But
when
a
species
with
any
extraordinarily
developed
organ
has
become
the
parent
of
many
modified
descendants
which
on
our
view
must
be
a
very
slow
process
,
requiring
long
lapse
of
time
in
this
case
,
natural
selection
has
succeeded
in
giving
a
fixed
character
to
the
organ
,
in
however
extraordinary
a
manner
it
may
have
been
developed
.
Species
inheriting
nearly
the
same
constitution
from
a
common
parent
,
and
exposed
to
similar
influences
,
naturally
tend
to
present
analogous
variations
,
or
these
same
species
may
occasionally
revert
to
some
of
the
characters
of
their
ancient
progenitors
.
Although
new
and
important
modifications
may
not
arise
from
reversion
and
analogous
variation
,
such
modifications
will
add
to
the
beautiful
and
harmonious
diversity
of
nature
.
Whatever
the
cause
may
be
of
each
slight
difference
between
the
offspring
and
their
parents
and
a
cause
for
each
must
exist
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
the
steady
accumulation
of
beneficial
differences
which
has
given
rise
to
all
the
more
important
modifications
of
structure
in
relation
to
the
habits
of
each
species
.
CHAPTER
VI
DIFFICULTIES
OF
THE
THEORY
LONG
before
the
reader
has
arrived
at
this
part
of
my
work
,
a
crowd
of
difficulties
will
have
occurred
to
him
.
Some
of
them
are
so
serious
that
to
this
day
I
can
hardly
reflect
on
them
without
being
in
some
degree
staggered
;
but
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
,
the
greater
number
are
only
apparent
,
and
those
that
are
real
are
not
,
I
think
,
fatal
to
the
theory
.
These
difficulties
and
objections
may
be
classed
under
the
following
heads
:
First
,
why
,
if
species
have
descended
from
other
species
by
fine
gradations
,
do
we
not
everywhere
see
innumerable
transitional
forms
?
Why
is
not
all
nature
in
confusion
,
instead
of
the
species
being
,
as
we
see
them
,
well
defined
?
Secondly
,
is
it
possible
that
an
animal
having
,
for
instance
,
the
structure
and
habits
of
a
bat
,
could
have
been
formed
by
the
modification
of
some
other
animal
with
widely
different
habits
and
structure
?
Can
we
believe
that
natural
selection
could
produce
,
on
the
one
hand
,
an
organ
of
trifling
importance
,
such
as
the
tail
of
a
giraffe
,
which
serves
as
a
fly
flapper
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
an
organ
so
wonderful
as
the
eye
?
Thirdly
,
can
instincts
be
acquired
and
modified
through
natural
selection
?
What
shall
we
say
to
the
instinct
which
leads
the
bee
to
make
cells
,
and
which
has
practically
anticipated
the
discoveries
of
profound
mathematicians
?
Fourthly
,
how
can
we
account
for
species
,
when
crossed
,
being
sterile
and
producing
sterile
offspring
,
whereas
,
when
varieties
are
crossed
,
their
fertility
is
unimpaired
?
The
two
first
heads
will
here
be
discussed
;
some
miscellaneous
objections
in
the
following
chapter
;
Instinct
and
Hybridism
in
the
two
succeeding
chapters
.
On
the
Absence
or
Rarity
of
Transitional
Varieties
.
As
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
profitable
modifications
,
each
new
form
will
tend
in
a
fully
stocked
country
to
take
the
place
of
,
and
finally
to
exterminate
,
its
own
less
improved
parent
form
and
other
less
favoured
forms
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
.
Thus
extinction
and
natural
selection
go
hand
in
hand
.
Hence
,
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
descended
from
some
unknown
form
,
both
the
parent
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
will
generally
have
been
exterminated
by
the
very
process
of
the
formation
and
perfection
of
the
new
form
.
But
,
as
by
this
theory
innumerable
transitional
forms
must
have
existed
,
why
do
we
not
find
them
embedded
in
countless
numbers
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
?
It
will
be
more
convenient
to
discuss
this
question
in
the
chapter
on
the
Imperfection
of
the
Geological
Record
;
and
I
will
here
only
state
that
I
believe
the
answer
mainly
lies
in
the
record
being
incomparably
less
perfect
than
is
generally
supposed
.
The
crust
of
the
earth
is
a
vast
museum
;
but
the
natural
connections
have
been
imperfectly
made
,
and
only
at
long
intervals
of
time
.
But
it
may
be
urged
that
when
several
closely
allied
species
inhabit
the
same
territory
,
we
surely
ought
to
find
at
the
present
time
many
transitional
forms
.
Let
us
take
a
simple
case
:
in
travelling
from
north
to
south
over
a
continent
,
we
generally
meet
at
successive
intervals
with
closely
allied
or
representative
species
,
evidently
filling
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
natural
economy
of
the
land
.
These
representative
species
often
meet
and
interlock
;
and
as
the
one
becomes
rarer
and
rarer
,
the
other
becomes
more
and
more
frequent
,
till
the
one
replaces
the
other
.
But
if
we
compare
these
species
where
they
intermingle
,
they
are
generally
as
absolutely
distinct
from
each
other
in
every
detail
of
structure
as
are
specimens
taken
from
the
metropolis
inhabited
by
each
.
By
my
theory
these
allied
species
are
descended
from
a
common
parent
;
and
during
the
process
of
modification
,
each
has
become
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
life
of
its
own
region
,
and
has
supplanted
and
exterminated
its
original
parent
form
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
between
its
past
and
present
states
.
Hence
we
ought
not
to
expect
at
the
present
time
to
meet
with
numerous
transitional
varieties
in
each
region
,
though
they
must
have
existed
there
,
and
may
be
embedded
there
in
a
fossil
condition
.
But
in
the
intermediate
region
,
having
intermediate
conditions
of
life
,
why
do
we
not
now
find
closely
linking
intermediate
varieties
?
This
difficulty
for
a
long
time
quite
confounded
me
.
But
I
think
it
can
be
in
large
part
explained
.
In
the
first
place
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
inferring
,
because
an
area
is
now
continuous
,
that
it
has
been
continuous
during
a
long
period
.
Geology
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
most
continents
have
been
broken
up
into
islands
even
during
the
later
tertiary
periods
;
and
in
such
islands
distinct
species
might
have
been
separately
formed
without
the
possibility
of
intermediate
varieties
existing
in
the
intermediate
zones
.
By
changes
in
the
form
of
the
land
and
of
climate
,
marine
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
existed
within
recent
times
in
a
far
less
continuous
and
uniform
condition
than
at
present
.
But
I
will
pass
over
this
way
of
escaping
from
the
difficulty
;
for
I
believe
that
many
perfectly
defined
species
have
been
formed
on
strictly
continuous
areas
;
though
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
formerly
broken
condition
of
areas
now
continuous
,
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
formation
of
new
species
,
more
especially
with
freely
crossing
and
wandering
animals
.
In
looking
at
species
as
they
are
now
distributed
over
a
wide
area
,
we
generally
find
them
tolerably
numerous
over
a
large
territory
,
then
becoming
somewhat
abruptly
rarer
and
rarer
on
the
confines
,
and
finally
disappearing
.
Hence
the
neutral
territory
between
two
representative
species
is
generally
narrow
in
comparison
with
the
territory
proper
to
each
.
We
see
the
same
fact
in
ascending
mountains
,
and
sometimes
it
is
quite
remarkable
how
abruptly
,
as
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
observed
,
a
common
alpine
species
disappears
.
The
same
fact
has
been
noticed
by
E
.
Forbes
in
sounding
the
depths
of
the
sea
with
the
dredge
.
To
those
who
look
at
climate
and
the
physical
conditions
of
life
as
the
all
important
elements
of
distribution
,
these
facts
ought
to
cause
surprise
,
as
climate
and
height
or
depth
graduate
away
insensibly
.
But
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
almost
every
species
,
even
in
its
metropolis
,
would
increase
immensely
in
numbers
,
were
it
not
for
other
competing
species
;
that
nearly
all
either
prey
on
or
serve
as
prey
for
others
;
in
short
,
that
each
organic
being
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
related
in
the
most
important
manner
to
other
organic
beings
,
we
see
that
the
range
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
country
by
no
means
exclusively
depends
on
insensibly
changing
physical
conditions
,
but
in
a
large
part
on
the
presence
of
other
species
,
on
which
it
lives
,
or
by
which
it
is
destroyed
,
or
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
;
and
as
these
species
are
already
defined
objects
,
not
blending
one
into
another
by
insensible
gradations
,
the
range
of
any
one
species
,
depending
as
does
on
the
range
of
others
,
will
tend
to
be
sharply
defined
.
Moreover
,
each
species
on
the
confines
of
its
range
,
where
it
exists
in
lessened
numbers
,
will
,
during
fluctuations
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
or
of
its
prey
,
or
in
the
nature
of
the
seasons
,
be
extremely
liable
to
utter
extermination
;
and
thus
its
geographical
range
will
come
to
be
still
more
sharply
defined
.
As
allied
or
representative
species
,
when
inhabiting
a
continuous
area
,
are
generally
distributed
in
such
a
manner
that
each
has
a
wide
range
,
with
a
comparatively
narrow
neutral
territory
between
them
,
in
which
they
become
rather
suddenly
rarer
and
rarer
;
then
,
as
varieties
do
not
essentially
differ
from
species
,
the
same
rule
will
probably
apply
to
both
;
and
if
we
take
a
varying
species
inhabiting
a
very
large
area
,
we
shall
have
to
adapt
two
varieties
to
two
large
areas
,
and
a
third
variety
to
a
narrow
intermediate
zone
.
The
intermediate
variety
,
consequently
,
will
exist
in
lesser
numbers
from
inhabiting
a
narrow
and
lesser
area
;
and
practically
,
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
this
rule
holds
good
with
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
.
I
have
met
with
striking
instances
of
the
rule
in
the
case
of
varieties
intermediate
between
well
marked
varieties
in
the
genus
Balanus
.
And
it
would
appear
from
information
given
me
by
Mr
.
Watson
,
Dr
.
Asa
Gray
,
and
Mr
.
Wollaston
,
that
generally
,
when
varieties
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
occur
,
they
are
much
rarer
numerically
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
.
Now
,
if
we
may
trust
these
facts
and
inferences
,
and
conclude
that
varieties
linking
two
other
varieties
together
generally
have
existed
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
,
then
we
can
understand
why
intermediate
varieties
should
not
endure
for
very
long
periods
:
why
,
as
a
general
rule
,
they
should
be
exterminated
and
disappear
,
sooner
than
the
forms
which
they
originally
linked
together
.
For
any
form
existing
in
lesser
numbers
would
,
as
already
remarked
,
run
a
greater
chance
of
being
exterminated
than
one
existing
in
large
numbers
;
and
in
this
particular
case
the
intermediate
form
would
be
eminently
liable
to
the
inroads
of
closely
allied
forms
existing
on
both
sides
of
it
.
But
it
is
a
far
more
important
consideration
,
that
during
the
process
of
further
modification
,
by
which
two
varieties
are
supposed
to
be
converted
and
perfected
into
two
distinct
species
,
the
two
which
exist
in
larger
numbers
,
from
inhabiting
larger
areas
,
will
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
intermediate
variety
,
which
exists
in
smaller
numbers
in
a
narrow
and
intermediate
zone
.
For
forms
existing
in
larger
numbers
will
have
a
better
chance
,
within
any
given
period
,
of
presenting
further
favourable
variations
for
natural
selection
to
seize
on
,
than
will
the
rarer
forms
which
exist
in
lesser
numbers
.
Hence
,
the
more
common
forms
,
in
the
race
for
life
,
will
tend
to
beat
and
supplant
the
less
common
forms
,
for
these
will
be
more
slowly
modified
and
improved
.
It
is
the
same
principle
which
,
as
I
believe
,
accounts
for
the
common
species
in
each
country
,
as
shown
in
the
second
chapter
,
presenting
on
an
average
a
greater
number
of
well
marked
varieties
than
do
the
rarer
species
.
I
may
illustrate
what
I
mean
by
supposing
three
varieties
of
sheep
to
be
kept
,
one
adapted
to
an
extensive
mountainous
region
;
a
second
to
a
comparatively
narrow
,
hilly
tract
;
and
a
third
to
the
wide
plains
at
the
base
;
and
that
the
inhabitants
are
all
trying
with
equal
steadiness
and
skill
to
improve
their
stocks
by
selection
;
the
chances
in
this
case
will
be
strongly
in
favour
of
the
great
holders
on
the
mountains
or
on
the
plains
,
improving
their
breeds
more
quickly
than
the
small
holders
on
the
intermediate
narrow
,
hilly
tract
;
and
consequently
the
improved
mountain
or
plain
breed
will
soon
take
the
place
of
the
less
improved
hill
breed
;
and
thus
the
two
breeds
,
which
originally
existed
in
greater
numbers
,
will
come
into
close
contact
with
each
other
,
without
the
interposition
of
the
supplanted
,
intermediate
hill
variety
.
To
sum
up
,
I
believe
that
species
come
to
be
tolerably
well
defined
objects
,
and
do
not
at
any
one
period
present
an
inextricable
chaos
of
varying
and
intermediate
links
;
first
,
because
new
varieties
are
very
slowly
formed
,
for
variation
is
a
slow
process
,
and
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
until
favourable
individual
differences
or
variations
occur
,
and
until
a
place
in
the
natural
polity
of
the
country
can
be
better
filled
by
some
modification
of
some
one
or
more
of
its
inhabitants
.
And
such
new
places
will
depend
on
slow
changes
of
climate
,
or
on
the
occasional
immigration
of
new
inhabitants
,
and
,
probably
,
in
a
still
more
important
degree
,
on
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
becoming
slowly
modified
,
with
the
new
forms
thus
produced
,
and
the
old
ones
acting
and
reacting
on
each
other
.
So
that
,
in
any
one
region
and
at
any
one
time
,
we
ought
to
see
only
a
few
species
presenting
slight
modifications
of
structure
in
some
degree
permanent
;
and
this
assuredly
we
do
see
.
Secondly
,
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
existed
within
the
recent
period
as
isolated
portions
,
in
which
many
forms
,
more
especially
amongst
the
classes
which
unite
for
each
birth
and
wander
much
,
may
have
separately
been
rendered
sufficiently
distinct
to
rank
as
representative
species
.
In
this
,
case
,
intermediate
varieties
between
the
several
representative
species
and
their
common
parent
,
must
formerly
have
existed
within
each
isolated
portion
of
the
land
,
but
these
links
during
the
process
of
natural
selection
will
have
been
supplanted
and
exterminated
,
so
that
they
will
no
longer
be
found
in
a
living
state
.
Thirdly
,
when
two
or
more
varieties
have
been
formed
in
different
portions
of
a
strictly
continuous
area
,
intermediate
varieties
will
,
it
is
probable
,
at
first
have
been
formed
in
the
intermediate
zones
,
but
they
will
generally
have
had
a
short
duration
.
For
these
intermediate
varieties
will
,
from
reasons
already
assigned
(
namely
from
what
we
know
of
the
actual
distribution
of
closely
allied
or
representative
species
,
and
likewise
of
acknowledged
varieties
)
,
exist
in
the
intermediate
zones
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
varieties
which
they
tend
to
connect
.
From
this
cause
alone
the
intermediate
varieties
will
be
liable
to
accidental
extermination
;
and
during
the
process
of
further
modification
through
natural
selection
,
they
will
almost
certainly
be
beaten
and
supplanted
by
the
forms
which
they
connect
;
for
these
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
will
,
in
the
aggregate
,
present
more
varieties
,
and
thus
be
further
improved
through
natural
selection
and
gain
further
advantages
.
Lastly
,
looking
not
to
any
one
time
,
but
to
all
time
,
if
my
theory
be
true
,
numberless
intermediate
varieties
,
linking
closely
together
all
the
species
of
the
same
group
,
must
assuredly
have
existed
;
but
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
constantly
tends
,
as
has
been
so
often
remarked
,
to
exterminate
the
parent
forms
and
the
intermediate
links
.
Consequently
evidence
of
their
former
existence
could
be
found
only
amongst
fossil
remains
,
which
are
preserved
,
as
we
shall
attempt
to
show
in
a
future
chapter
,
in
an
extremely
imperfect
and
intermittent
record
.
On
the
Origin
and
Transitions
of
Organic
Beings
with
peculiar
Habits
and
Structure
.
It
has
been
asked
by
the
opponents
of
such
views
as
I
hold
,
how
,
for
instance
,
could
a
land
carnivorous
animal
have
been
converted
into
one
with
aquatic
habits
;
for
how
could
the
animal
in
its
transitional
state
have
subsisted
?
It
would
be
easy
to
show
that
there
now
exist
carnivorous
animals
presenting
close
intermediate
grades
from
strictly
terrestrial
to
aquatic
habits
;
and
as
each
exists
by
a
struggle
for
life
,
it
is
clear
that
each
must
be
well
adapted
to
its
place
in
nature
.
Look
at
the
Mustela
vision
of
North
America
,
which
has
webbed
feet
,
and
which
resembles
an
otter
in
its
fur
,
short
legs
,
and
form
of
tail
.
During
the
summer
this
animal
dives
for
and
preys
on
fish
,
but
during
the
long
winter
it
leaves
the
frozen
waters
,
and
preys
,
like
other
pole
cats
,
on
mice
and
land
animals
.
If
a
different
case
had
been
taken
,
and
it
had
been
asked
how
an
insectivorous
quadruped
could
possibly
have
been
converted
into
a
flying
bat
,
the
question
would
have
been
far
more
difficult
to
answer
.
Yet
I
think
such
difficulties
have
little
weight
.
Here
,
as
on
other
occasions
,
I
lie
under
a
heavy
disadvantage
,
for
,
out
of
the
many
striking
cases
which
I
have
collected
,
I
can
only
give
one
or
two
instances
of
transitional
habits
and
structures
in
allied
species
;
and
of
diversified
habits
,
either
constant
or
occasional
,
in
the
same
species
.
And
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
less
than
a
long
list
of
such
cases
is
sufficient
to
lessen
the
difficulty
in
any
particular
case
like
that
of
the
bat
.
Look
at
the
family
of
squirrels
;
here
we
have
the
finest
gradation
from
animals
with
their
tails
only
slightly
flattened
,
and
from
others
,
as
Sir
J
.
Richardson
has
remarked
,
with
the
posterior
part
of
their
bodies
rather
wide
and
with
the
skin
on
their
flanks
rather
full
,
to
the
so
called
flying
squirrels
;
and
flying
squirrels
have
their
limbs
and
even
the
base
of
the
tail
united
by
a
broad
expanse
of
skin
,
which
serves
as
a
parachute
and
allows
them
to
glide
through
the
air
to
an
astonishing
distance
from
tree
to
tree
.
We
cannot
doubt
that
each
structure
is
of
use
to
each
kind
of
squirrel
in
its
own
country
,
by
enabling
it
to
escape
birds
or
beasts
of
prey
,
to
collect
food
more
quickly
,
or
,
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
,
to
lessen
the
danger
from
occasional
falls
.
But
it
does
not
follow
from
this
fact
that
the
structure
of
each
squirrel
is
the
best
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
under
all
possible
conditions
.
Let
the
climate
and
vegetation
change
,
let
other
competing
rodents
or
new
beasts
of
prey
immigrate
,
or
old
ones
become
modified
,
and
all
analogy
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
some
at
least
of
the
squirrels
would
decrease
in
numbers
or
become
exterminated
,
unless
they
also
become
modified
and
improved
in
structure
in
a
corresponding
manner
.
Therefore
,
I
can
see
no
difficulty
,
more
especially
under
changing
conditions
of
life
,
in
the
continued
preservation
of
individuals
with
fuller
and
fuller
flank
membranes
,
each
modification
being
,
useful
,
each
being
propagated
,
until
,
by
the
accumulated
effects
of
this
process
of
natural
selection
,
a
perfect
so
called
flying
squirrel
was
produced
.
Now
look
at
the
Galeopithecus
or
so
called
flying
lemur
,
which
formerly
was
ranked
amongst
bats
,
but
is
now
believed
to
belong
to
the
Insectivora
.
An
extremely
wide
flank
membrane
stretches
from
the
corners
of
the
jaw
to
the
tail
,
and
includes
the
limbs
with
the
elongated
fingers
.
This
flank
membrane
is
furnished
with
an
extensor
muscle
.
Although
no
graduated
links
of
structure
,
fitted
for
gliding
through
the
air
,
now
connect
the
Galeopithecus
with
the
other
Insectivora
,
yet
there
is
no
difficulty
in
supposing
that
such
links
formerly
existed
,
and
that
each
was
developed
in
the
same
manner
as
with
the
less
perfectly
gliding
squirrels
;
each
grade
of
structure
having
been
useful
to
its
possessor
.
Nor
can
I
see
any
insuperable
difficulty
in
further
believing
that
the
membrane
connected
fingers
and
fore
arm
of
the
Galeopithecus
might
have
been
greatly
lengthened
by
natural
selection
;
and
this
,
as
far
as
the
organs
of
flight
are
concerned
,
would
have
converted
the
animal
into
a
bat
.
In
certain
bats
in
which
the
wing
membrane
extends
from
the
top
of
the
shoulder
to
the
tail
and
includes
the
hind
legs
,
we
perhaps
see
traces
of
an
apparatus
originally
fitted
for
gliding
through
the
air
rather
than
for
flight
.
If
about
a
dozen
genera
of
birds
were
to
become
extinct
,
who
would
have
ventured
to
surmise
that
birds
might
have
existed
which
used
their
wings
solely
as
flappers
,
like
the
logger
headed
duck
(
Micropterus
of
Eyton
)
;
as
fins
in
the
water
and
as
front
legs
on
the
land
,
like
the
penguin
;
as
sails
,
like
the
ostrich
;
and
functionally
for
no
purpose
,
like
the
Apteryx
?
Yet
the
structure
of
each
of
these
birds
is
good
for
it
,
under
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
it
is
exposed
,
for
each
has
to
live
by
a
struggle
;
but
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
possible
under
all
possible
conditions
.
It
must
not
be
inferred
from
these
remarks
that
any
of
the
grades
of
wing
structure
here
alluded
to
,
which
perhaps
may
all
be
the
result
of
disuse
,
indicate
the
steps
by
which
birds
actually
acquired
their
perfect
power
of
flight
;
but
they
serve
to
show
what
diversified
means
of
transition
are
at
least
possible
.
Seeing
that
a
few
members
of
such
water
breathing
classes
as
the
Crustacea
and
Mollusca
are
adapted
to
live
on
the
land
;
and
seeing
that
we
have
flying
birds
and
mammals
,
flying
insects
of
the
most
diversified
types
,
and
formerly
had
flying
reptiles
,
it
is
conceivable
that
flying
fish
,
which
now
glide
far
through
the
air
,
slightly
rising
and
turning
by
the
aid
of
their
fluttering
fins
,
might
have
been
modified
into
perfectly
winged
animals
.
If
this
had
been
effected
,
who
would
have
ever
imagined
that
in
an
early
transitional
state
they
had
been
the
inhabitants
of
the
open
ocean
,
and
had
used
their
incipient
organs
of
flight
exclusively
,
as
far
as
we
know
,
to
escape
being
devoured
by
other
fish
?
When
we
see
any
structure
highly
perfected
for
any
particular
habit
,
as
the
wings
of
a
bird
for
flight
,
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
animals
displaying
early
transitional
grades
of
the
structure
will
seldom
have
survived
to
the
present
day
,
for
they
will
have
been
supplanted
by
their
successors
,
which
were
gradually
rendered
more
perfect
through
natural
selection
.
Furthermore
,
we
may
conclude
that
transitional
states
between
structures
fitted
for
very
different
habits
of
life
will
rarely
have
been
developed
at
an
early
period
in
great
numbers
and
under
many
subordinate
forms
.
Thus
,
to
return
to
our
imaginary
illustration
of
the
flying
fish
,
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
fishes
capable
of
true
flight
would
have
been
developed
under
many
subordinate
forms
,
for
taking
prey
of
many
kinds
in
many
ways
,
on
the
land
and
in
the
water
,
until
their
organs
of
flight
had
come
to
a
high
stage
of
perfection
,
so
as
to
have
given
them
a
decided
advantage
over
other
animals
in
the
battle
for
life
.
Hence
the
chance
of
discovering
species
with
transitional
grades
of
structure
in
a
fossil
condition
will
always
be
less
,
from
their
having
existed
in
lesser
numbers
,
than
in
the
case
of
species
with
fully
developed
structures
.
I
will
now
give
two
or
three
instances
both
of
diversified
and
of
changed
habits
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
.
In
either
case
it
would
be
easy
for
natural
selection
to
adapt
the
structure
of
the
animal
to
its
changed
habits
,
or
exclusively
to
one
of
its
several
habits
.
It
is
,
however
,
difficult
to
decide
,
and
immaterial
for
us
,
whether
habits
generally
change
first
and
structure
afterwards
;
or
whether
slight
modifications
of
structure
lead
to
changed
habits
;
both
probably
often
occurring
almost
simultaneously
.
Of
cases
of
changed
habits
it
will
suffice
merely
to
allude
to
that
of
the
many
British
insects
which
now
feed
on
exotic
plants
,
or
exclusively
on
artificial
substances
.
Of
diversified
habits
innumerable
instances
could
be
given
:
I
have
often
watched
a
tyrant
flycatcher
(
Saurophagus
sulphuratus
)
in
South
America
,
hovering
over
one
spot
and
then
proceeding
to
another
,
like
a
kestrel
,
and
at
other
times
standing
stationary
on
the
margin
of
water
,
and
then
dashing
into
it
like
a
kingfisher
at
a
fish
.
In
our
own
country
the
larger
titmouse
(
Parus
major
)
may
be
seen
climbing
branches
,
almost
like
a
creeper
;
it
sometimes
,
like
a
shrike
,
kills
small
birds
by
blows
on
the
head
;
and
I
have
many
times
seen
and
heard
it
hammering
the
seeds
of
the
yew
on
a
branch
,
and
thus
breaking
them
like
a
nuthatch
.
In
North
America
the
black
bear
was
seen
by
Hearne
swimming
for
hours
with
widely
open
mouth
,
thus
catching
,
almost
like
a
whale
,
insects
in
the
water
.
As
we
sometimes
see
individuals
following
habits
different
from
those
proper
to
their
species
and
to
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
,
we
might
expect
that
such
individuals
would
occasionally
give
rise
to
new
species
,
having
anomalous
habits
,
and
with
their
structure
either
slightly
or
considerably
modified
from
that
of
their
type
.
And
such
instances
occur
in
nature
.
Can
a
more
striking
instance
of
adaptation
be
given
than
that
of
a
woodpecker
for
climbing
trees
and
seizing
insects
in
the
chinks
of
the
bark
?
Yet
in
North
America
there
are
woodpeckers
which
feed
largely
on
fruit
,
and
others
with
elongated
wings
which
chase
insects
on
the
wing
.
On
the
plains
of
La
Plata
,
where
hardly
a
tree
grows
,
there
is
a
woodpecker
(
Colaptes
campestris
)
which
has
two
toes
before
and
two
behind
,
a
long
pointed
tongue
,
pointed
tail
feathers
,
sufficiently
stiff
to
support
the
bird
in
a
vertical
position
on
a
post
,
but
not
so
stiff
as
in
the
typical
woodpeckers
,
and
a
straight
strong
beak
.
The
beak
,
however
,
is
not
so
straight
or
so
strong
as
in
the
typical
woodpeckers
,
but
it
is
strong
enough
to
bore
into
wood
.
Hence
this
Colaptes
in
all
the
essential
parts
of
its
structure
is
a
woodpecker
.
Even
in
such
trifling
characters
as
the
colouring
,
the
harsh
tone
of
the
voice
,
and
undulatory
flight
,
its
close
blood
relationship
to
our
common
woodpecker
is
plainly
declared
;
yet
,
as
I
can
assert
,
not
only
from
my
own
observation
,
but
from
those
of
the
accurate
Azara
,
in
certain
large
districts
it
does
not
climb
trees
,
and
it
makes
its
nest
in
holes
in
banks!
In
certain
other
districts
,
however
,
this
same
woodpecker
,
as
Mr
.
Hudson
states
,
frequents
trees
,
and
bores
holes
in
the
trunk
for
its
nest
.
I
may
mention
as
another
illustration
of
the
varied
habits
of
this
genus
,
that
a
Mexican
Colaptes
has
been
described
by
De
Saussure
as
boring
holes
into
hard
wood
in
order
to
lay
up
a
store
of
acorns
.
Petrels
are
the
most
aerial
and
oceanic
of
birds
,
but
in
the
quiet
sounds
of
Tierra
del
Fuego
,
the
Puffinuria
berardi
,
in
its
general
habits
,
in
its
astonishing
power
of
diving
,
in
its
manner
of
swimming
and
of
flying
when
made
to
take
flight
,
would
be
mistaken
by
any
one
for
an
auk
or
a
grebe
;
nevertheless
it
is
essentially
a
petrel
,
but
with
many
parts
of
its
organisation
profoundly
modified
in
relation
to
its
new
habits
of
life
;
whereas
the
woodpecker
of
La
Plata
has
had
its
structure
only
slightly
modified
.
In
the
case
of
the
waterouzel
,
the
acutest
observer
by
examining
its
dead
body
would
never
have
suspected
its
subaquatic
habits
;
yet
this
bird
,
which
is
allied
to
the
thrush
family
,
subsists
by
diving
using
its
wings
under
water
,
and
grasping
stones
with
its
feet
.
All
the
members
of
the
great
order
of
hymenopterous
insects
are
terrestrial
excepting
the
genus
Proctotrupes
,
which
Sir
John
Lubbock
has
discovered
to
be
aquatic
in
its
habits
;
it
often
enters
the
water
and
dives
about
by
the
use
not
of
its
legs
but
of
its
wings
,
and
remains
as
long
as
four
hours
beneath
the
surface
;
yet
it
exhibits
no
modification
in
structure
in
accordance
with
its
abnormal
habits
.
He
who
believes
that
each
being
has
been
created
as
we
now
see
it
,
must
occasionally
have
felt
surprise
when
he
has
met
with
an
animal
having
habits
and
structure
not
in
agreement
.
What
can
be
plainer
than
that
the
webbed
feet
of
ducks
and
geese
are
formed
for
swimming
?
Yet
there
are
upland
geese
with
webbed
feet
which
rarely
go
near
the
water
;
and
no
one
except
Audubon
has
seen
the
frigate
bird
,
which
has
all
its
four
toes
webbed
,
alight
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
.
On
the
other
hand
,
grebes
and
coots
are
eminently
aquatic
,
although
their
toes
are
only
bordered
by
membrane
.
What
seems
plainer
than
that
the
long
toes
,
not
furnished
with
membrane
,
of
the
Grallatores
are
formed
for
walking
over
swamps
and
floating
plants
?
the
water
hen
and
landrail
are
members
of
this
order
,
yet
the
first
is
nearly
as
aquatic
as
the
coot
,
and
the
second
nearly
as
terrestrial
as
the
quail
or
partridge
.
In
such
cases
,
and
many
others
could
be
given
,
habits
have
changed
without
a
corresponding
change
of
structure
.
The
webbed
feet
of
the
upland
goose
may
be
said
to
have
become
almost
rudimentary
in
function
,
though
not
in
structure
.
In
the
frigate
bird
,
the
deeply
scooped
membrane
between
the
toes
shows
that
structure
has
begun
to
change
.
He
who
believes
in
separate
and
innumerable
acts
of
creation
may
say
,
that
in
these
cases
it
has
pleased
the
Creator
to
cause
a
being
of
one
type
to
take
the
place
of
one
belonging
to
another
type
;
but
this
seems
to
me
only
re
stating
the
fact
in
dignified
language
.
He
who
believes
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
in
the
principle
of
natural
selection
,
will
acknowledge
that
every
organic
being
is
constantly
endeavouring
to
increase
in
numbers
;
and
that
if
any
one
being
varies
ever
so
little
,
either
in
habits
or
structure
,
and
thus
gains
an
advantage
over
some
other
inhabitant
of
the
same
country
,
it
will
seize
on
the
place
of
that
inhabitant
,
however
different
that
may
be
from
its
own
place
.
Hence
it
will
cause
him
no
surprise
that
there
should
be
geese
and
frigatebirds
with
webbed
feet
,
living
on
the
dry
land
and
rarely
alighting
on
the
water
;
that
there
should
be
long
toed
corncrakes
,
living
in
meadows
instead
of
in
swamps
;
that
there
should
be
woodpeckers
where
hardly
a
tree
grows
;
that
there
should
be
diving
thrushes
and
diving
Hymenoptera
,
and
petrels
with
the
habits
of
auks
.
Organs
of
extreme
Perfection
and
Complication
To
suppose
that
the
eye
with
all
its
inimitable
contrivances
for
adjusting
the
focus
to
different
distances
,
for
admitting
different
amounts
of
light
,
and
for
the
correction
of
spherical
and
chromatic
aberration
,
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
,
seems
,
I
freely
confess
,
absurd
in
the
highest
degree
.
When
it
was
first
said
that
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
world
turned
round
,
the
common
sense
of
mankind
declared
the
doctrine
false
;
but
the
old
saying
of
Vox
populi
,
vox
Dei
,
as
every
philosopher
knows
,
cannot
be
trusted
in
science
.
Reason
tells
me
,
that
if
numerous
gradations
from
a
simple
and
imperfect
eye
to
one
complex
and
perfect
can
be
shown
to
exist
,
each
grade
being
useful
to
its
possessor
,
as
is
certainly
the
case
;
if
further
,
the
eye
ever
varies
and
the
variations
be
inherited
,
as
is
likewise
certainly
the
case
and
if
such
variations
should
be
useful
to
any
animal
under
changing
conditions
of
life
,
then
the
difficulty
of
believing
that
a
perfect
and
complex
eye
could
be
formed
by
natural
selection
,
though
insuperable
by
our
imagination
,
should
not
be
considered
as
subversive
of
the
theory
.
How
a
nerve
comes
to
be
sensitive
to
light
,
hardly
concerns
us
more
than
how
life
itself
originated
;
but
I
may
remark
that
,
as
some
of
the
lowest
organisms
,
in
which
nerves
cannot
be
detected
,
are
capable
of
perceiving
light
,
it
does
not
seem
impossible
that
certain
sensitive
elements
in
their
sarcode
should
become
aggregated
and
developed
into
nerves
,
endowed
with
this
special
sensibility
.
In
searching
for
the
gradations
through
which
an
orgain
in
any
species
has
been
perfected
,
we
ought
to
look
exclusively
to
its
lineal
progenitors
;
but
this
is
scarcely
ever
possible
,
and
we
are
forced
to
look
to
other
species
and
genera
of
the
same
group
,
that
is
to
the
collateral
descendants
from
the
same
parent
form
,
in
order
to
see
what
gradations
are
possible
,
and
for
the
chance
of
some
gradations
having
been
transmitted
in
an
unaltered
or
little
altered
condition
.
But
the
state
of
the
same
organ
in
distinct
classes
may
incidentally
throw
light
on
the
steps
by
which
it
has
been
perfected
.
The
simplest
organ
which
can
be
called
an
eye
consists
of
an
optic
nerve
,
surrounded
by
pigment
cells
,
and
covered
by
translucent
skin
,
but
without
any
lens
or
other
refractive
body
.
We
may
,
however
,
according
to
M
.
Jourdain
,
descend
even
a
step
lower
and
find
aggregates
of
pigment
cells
,
apparently
serving
as
organs
of
vision
,
without
any
nerves
,
and
resting
merely
on
sarcodic
tissue
.
Eyes
of
the
above
simple
nature
are
not
capable
of
distinct
vision
,
and
serve
only
to
distinguish
light
from
darkness
.
In
certain
star
fishes
,
small
depressions
in
the
layer
of
pigment
which
surrounds
the
nerve
are
filled
,
as
described
by
the
author
just
quoted
,
with
transparent
gelatinous
matter
,
projecting
with
a
convex
surface
,
like
the
cornea
in
the
higher
animals
.
He
suggests
that
this
serves
not
to
form
an
image
,
but
only
to
concentrate
the
luminous
rays
and
render
their
perception
more
easy
.
In
this
concentration
of
the
rays
we
gain
the
first
and
by
far
the
most
important
step
towards
the
formation
of
a
true
,
picture
forming
eye
;
for
we
have
only
to
place
the
naked
extremity
of
the
optic
nerve
,
which
in
some
of
the
lower
animals
lies
deeply
buried
in
the
body
,
and
in
some
near
the
surface
,
at
the
right
distance
from
the
concentrating
apparatus
,
and
an
image
will
be
formed
on
it
.
In
the
great
class
of
the
Articulata
,
we
may
start
from
an
optic
nerve
simply
coated
with
pigment
,
the
latter
sometimes
forming
a
sort
of
pupil
,
but
destitute
of
a
lens
or
other
optical
contrivance
.
With
insects
it
is
now
known
that
the
numerous
facets
on
the
cornea
of
their
great
compound
eyes
form
true
lenses
,
and
that
the
cones
include
curiously
modified
nervous
filaments
.
But
these
organs
in
the
Articulata
are
so
much
diversified
that
Muller
formerly
made
three
main
classes
with
seven
subdivisions
,
besides
a
fourth
main
class
of
aggregated
simple
eyes
.
When
we
reflect
on
these
facts
,
here
given
much
too
briefly
,
with
respect
to
the
wide
,
diversified
,
and
graduated
range
of
structure
in
the
eyes
of
the
lower
animals
;
and
when
we
bear
in
mind
how
small
the
number
of
all
living
forms
must
be
in
comparison
with
those
which
have
become
extinct
,
the
difficulty
ceases
to
be
very
great
in
believing
that
natural
selection
may
have
converted
the
simple
apparatus
of
an
optic
nerve
,
coated
with
pigment
and
invested
by
transparent
membrane
,
into
an
optical
instrument
as
perfect
as
is
possessed
by
any
member
of
the
articulate
class
.
He
who
will
go
thus
far
,
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
go
one
step
further
,
if
he
finds
on
finishing
this
volume
that
large
bodies
of
facts
,
otherwise
inexplicable
,
can
be
explained
by
the
theory
of
modification
through
natural
selection
;
he
ought
to
admit
that
a
structure
even
as
perfect
as
an
eagle's
eye
might
thus
be
formed
,
although
in
this
case
he
does
not
know
the
transitional
states
.
It
has
been
objected
that
in
order
to
modify
the
eye
and
still
preserve
it
as
a
perfect
instrument
,
many
changes
would
have
to
be
effected
simultaneously
,
which
,
it
is
assumed
,
could
not
be
done
through
natural
selection
;
but
as
I
have
attempted
to
show
in
my
work
on
the
variation
of
domestic
animals
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
modifications
were
all
simultaneous
,
if
they
were
extremely
slight
and
gradual
.
Different
kinds
of
modification
would
,
also
,
serve
for
the
same
general
purpose
:
as
Mr
.
Wallace
has
remarked
,
"
if
a
lens
has
too
short
or
too
long
a
focus
,
it
may
be
amended
either
by
an
alteration
of
curvature
,
or
an
alteration
of
density
;
if
the
curvature
be
irregular
,
and
the
rays
do
not
converge
to
a
point
,
then
any
increased
regularity
of
curvature
will
be
an
improvement
.
So
the
contraction
of
the
iris
and
the
muscular
movements
of
the
eye
are
neither
of
them
essential
to
vision
,
but
only
improvements
which
might
have
been
added
and
perfected
at
any
stage
of
the
construction
of
the
instrument
.
"
Within
the
highest
division
of
the
animal
kingdom
,
namely
,
the
Vertebrata
,
we
can
start
from
an
eye
so
simple
,
that
it
consists
,
as
in
the
lancelet
,
of
a
little
sack
of
transparent
skin
,
furnished
with
a
nerve
and
lined
with
pigment
,
but
destitute
of
any
other
apparatus
.
In
fishes
and
reptiles
,
as
Owen
has
remarked
,
"
the
range
of
gradations
of
dioptric
structures
is
very
great
.
"
It
is
a
significant
fact
that
even
in
man
,
according
to
the
high
authority
of
Virchow
,
the
beautiful
crystalline
lens
is
formed
in
the
embryo
by
an
accumulation
of
epidermic
cells
,
lying
in
a
sack
like
fold
of
the
skin
;
and
the
vitreous
body
is
formed
from
embryonic
sub
cutaneous
tissue
.
To
arrive
,
however
,
at
a
just
conclusion
regarding
the
formation
of
the
eye
,
with
all
its
marvellous
yet
not
absolutely
perfect
characters
,
it
is
indispensable
that
the
reason
should
conquer
the
imagination
;
but
I
have
felt
the
difficulty
far
too
keenly
to
be
surprised
at
others
hesitating
to
extend
the
principle
of
natural
selection
to
so
startling
a
length
.
It
is
scarcely
possible
to
avoid
comparing
the
eye
with
a
telescope
.
We
know
that
this
instrument
has
been
perfected
by
the
long
continued
efforts
of
the
highest
human
intellects
;
and
we
naturally
infer
that
the
eye
has
been
formed
by
a
somewhat
analogous
process
.
But
may
not
this
inference
be
presumptuous
?
Have
we
any
right
to
assume
that
the
Creator
works
by
intellectual
powers
like
those
of
man
?
If
we
must
compare
the
eye
to
an
optical
instrument
,
we
ought
in
imagination
to
take
a
thick
layer
of
transparent
tissue
,
with
spaces
filled
with
fluid
,
and
with
a
nerve
sensitive
to
light
beneath
,
and
then
suppose
every
part
of
this
layer
to
be
continually
changing
slowly
in
density
,
so
as
to
separate
into
layers
of
different
densities
and
thicknesses
,
placed
at
different
distances
from
each
other
,
and
with
the
surfaces
of
each
layer
slowly
changing
in
form
.
Further
we
must
suppose
that
there
is
a
power
,
represented
by
natural
selection
or
the
survival
of
the
fittest
,
always
intently
watching
each
slight
alteration
in
the
transparent
layers
;
and
carefully
preserving
each
which
,
under
varied
circumstances
,
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree
,
tends
to
produce
a
distincter
image
.
We
must
suppose
each
new
state
of
the
instrument
to
be
multiplied
by
the
million
;
each
to
be
preserved
until
a
better
one
is
produced
,
and
then
the
old
ones
to
be
all
destroyed
.
In
living
bodies
,
variation
will
cause
the
slight
alterations
,
generation
will
multiply
them
almost
infinitely
,
and
natural
selection
will
pick
out
with
unerring
skill
each
improvement
.
Let
this
process
go
on
for
millions
of
years
;
and
during
each
year
on
millions
of
individuals
of
many
kinds
;
and
may
we
not
believe
that
a
living
optical
instrument
might
thus
be
formed
as
superior
to
one
of
glass
,
as
the
works
of
the
Creator
are
to
those
of
man
?
Modes
of
Transition
If
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
any
complex
organ
existed
,
which
could
not
possibly
have
been
formed
by
numerous
,
successive
,
slight
modifications
,
my
theory
would
absolutely
break
down
.
But
I
can
find
out
no
such
case
.
No
doubt
many
organs
exist
of
which
we
do
not
know
the
transitional
grades
,
more
especially
if
we
look
to
much
isolated
species
,
round
which
,
according
to
the
theory
,
there
has
been
much
extinction
.
Or
again
,
if
we
take
an
organ
common
to
all
the
members
of
a
class
,
for
in
this
latter
case
the
organ
must
have
been
originally
formed
at
a
remote
period
,
since
which
all
the
many
members
of
the
class
have
been
developed
;
and
in
order
to
discover
the
early
transitional
grades
through
which
the
organ
has
passed
,
we
should
have
to
look
to
very
ancient
ancestral
forms
,
long
since
become
extinct
.
We
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
an
organ
could
not
have
been
formed
by
transitional
gradations
of
some
kind
.
Numerous
cases
could
be
given
amongst
the
lower
animals
of
the
same
organ
performing
at
the
same
time
wholly
distinct
functions
;
thus
in
the
larva
of
the
dragon
fly
and
in
the
fish
Cobitis
the
alimentary
canal
respires
,
digests
,
and
excretes
.
In
the
Hydra
,
the
animal
may
be
turned
inside
out
,
and
the
exterior
surface
will
then
digest
and
the
stomach
respire
.
In
such
cases
natural
selection
might
specialise
,
if
any
advantage
were
thus
gained
,
the
whole
or
part
of
an
organ
,
which
had
previously
performed
two
functions
,
for
one
function
alone
,
and
thus
by
insensible
steps
greatly
change
its
nature
.
Many
plants
are
known
which
regularly
produce
at
the
same
time
differently
constructed
flowers
;
and
if
such
plants
were
to
produce
one
kind
alone
,
a
great
change
would
be
effected
with
comparative
suddenness
in
the
character
of
the
species
.
It
is
,
however
,
probable
that
the
two
sorts
of
flowers
borne
by
the
same
plant
were
originally
differentiated
by
finely
graduated
steps
,
which
may
still
be
followed
in
some
few
cases
.
Again
,
two
distinct
organs
,
or
the
same
organ
under
two
very
different
forms
,
may
simultaneously
perform
in
the
same
individual
the
same
function
,
and
this
is
an
extremely
important
means
of
transition
:
to
give
one
instance
,
there
are
fish
with
gills
or
branchiae
that
breathe
the
air
dissolved
in
the
water
,
at
the
same
time
that
they
breathe
free
air
in
their
swimbladders
,
this
latter
organ
being
divided
by
highly
vascular
partitions
and
having
a
ductus
pneumaticus
for
the
supply
of
air
.
To
give
another
instance
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
:
plants
climb
by
three
distinct
means
,
by
spirally
twining
,
by
clasping
a
support
with
their
sensitive
tendrils
,
and
by
the
emission
of
aerial
rootlets
;
these
three
means
are
usually
found
in
distinct
groups
,
but
some
few
species
exhibit
two
of
the
means
,
or
even
all
three
,
combined
in
the
same
individual
.
In
all
such
cases
one
of
the
two
organs
might
readily
be
modified
and
perfected
so
as
to
perform
all
the
work
,
being
aided
during
the
progress
of
modification
by
the
other
organ
;
and
then
this
other
organ
might
be
modified
for
some
other
and
quite
distinct
purpose
,
or
be
wholly
obliterated
.
The
illustration
of
the
swimbladder
in
fishes
is
a
good
one
,
because
it
shows
us
clearly
the
highly
important
fact
that
an
organ
originally
constructed
for
one
purpose
,
namely
,
flotation
,
may
be
converted
into
one
for
a
widely
different
purpose
,
namely
,
respiration
.
The
swimbladder
has
,
also
,
been
worked
in
as
an
accessory
to
the
auditory
organs
of
certain
fishes
.
All
physiologists
admit
that
the
swimbladder
is
homologous
,
or
"
ideally
similar
"
in
position
and
structure
with
the
lungs
of
the
higher
vertebrate
animals
:
hence
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
swimbladder
has
actually
been
converted
into
lungs
,
or
an
organ
used
exclusively
for
respiration
.
According
to
this
view
it
may
be
inferred
that
all
vertebrate
animals
with
true
lungs
are
descended
by
ordinary
generation
from
an
ancient
and
unknown
prototype
,
which
was
furnished
with
a
floating
apparatus
or
swimbladder
.
We
can
thus
,
as
I
infer
from
Owen's
interesting
description
of
these
parts
,
understand
the
strange
fact
that
every
particle
of
food
and
drink
&
which
we
swallow
has
to
pass
over
the
orifice
of
the
trachea
,
with
some
risk
of
falling
into
the
lungs
,
notwithstanding
the
beautiful
contrivance
by
which
the
glottis
is
closed
.
In
the
higher
Vertebrate
the
branchiae
have
wholly
disappeared
but
in
the
embryo
the
slits
on
the
sides
of
the
neck
and
the
loop
like
course
of
the
arteries
still
mark
their
former
position
.
But
it
is
conceivable
that
the
now
utterly
lost
branchiae
might
have
been
gradually
worked
in
by
natural
selection
for
some
distinct
purpose
:
for
instance
,
Landois
has
shown
that
the
wings
of
insects
are
developed
from
the
tracheae
;
it
is
therefore
highly
probable
that
in
this
great
class
organs
which
once
served
for
respiration
have
been
actually
converted
into
organs
for
flight
.
In
considering
transitions
of
organs
,
it
is
so
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
probability
of
conversion
from
one
function
to
another
,
that
I
will
give
another
instance
.
Pedunculated
cirripedes
have
two
minute
folds
of
skin
,
called
by
me
the
ovigerous
frena
,
which
serve
,
through
the
means
of
a
sticky
secretion
,
to
retain
the
eggs
until
they
are
hatched
within
the
sack
.
These
cirripedes
have
no
branchiae
,
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
and
of
the
sack
,
together
with
the
small
frena
,
serving
for
respiration
.
The
Balanidae
or
sessile
cirripedes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
no
ovigerous
frena
,
the
eggs
lying
loose
at
the
bottom
of
the
sack
,
within
the
well
enclosed
shell
;
but
they
have
,
in
the
same
relative
position
with
the
frena
,
large
,
much
folded
membranes
,
which
freely
communicate
with
the
circulatory
lacunae
of
the
sack
and
body
,
and
which
have
been
considered
by
all
naturalists
to
act
as
branchiae
.
Now
I
think
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
ovigerous
frena
in
the
one
family
are
strictly
homologous
with
the
branchiae
of
the
other
family
;
indeed
,
they
graduate
into
each
other
.
Therefore
it
need
not
be
doubted
that
the
two
little
folds
of
skin
,
which
originally
served
as
ovigerous
frena
,
but
which
,
likewise
,
very
slightly
aided
in
the
act
of
respiration
,
have
been
gradually
converted
by
natural
selection
into
branchiae
simply
through
an
increase
in
their
size
and
the
obliteration
of
their
adhesive
glands
.
If
all
pedunculated
cirripedes
had
become
extinct
,
and
they
have
suffered
far
more
extinction
than
have
sessile
cirripedes
,
who
would
ever
have
imagined
that
the
branchiae
in
this
latter
family
had
originally
existed
as
organs
for
preventing
the
ova
from
being
washed
out
of
the
sack
?
There
is
another
possible
mode
of
transition
,
namely
,
through
the
acceleration
or
retardation
of
the
period
of
reproduction
.
This
has
lately
been
insisted
on
by
Prof
.
Cope
and
others
in
the
United
States
.
It
is
now
known
that
some
animals
are
capable
of
reproduction
at
a
very
early
age
,
before
they
have
acquired
their
perfect
characters
;
and
if
this
power
became
thoroughly
well
developed
in
a
species
,
it
seems
probable
that
the
adult
stage
of
development
would
sooner
or
later
be
lost
;
and
in
this
case
,
especially
if
the
larva
differed
much
from
the
mature
form
,
the
character
of
the
species
would
be
greatly
changed
and
degraded
.
Again
,
not
a
few
animals
,
after
arriving
at
maturity
,
go
on
changing
in
character
during
nearly
their
whole
lives
.
With
mammals
,
for
instance
,
the
form
of
the
skull
is
often
much
altered
with
age
,
of
which
Dr
.
Murie
has
given
some
striking
instances
with
seals
;
every
one
knows
how
the
horns
of
stags
become
more
and
more
branched
,
and
the
plumes
of
some
birds
become
more
finely
developed
,
as
they
grow
older
.
Prof
.
Cope
states
that
the
teeth
of
certain
lizards
change
much
in
shape
with
advancing
years
;
with
crustaceans
not
only
many
trivial
,
but
some
important
parts
assume
a
new
character
,
as
recorded
by
Fritz
Muller
,
after
maturity
.
In
all
such
cases
,
and
many
could
be
given
,
if
the
age
for
reproduction
were
retarded
,
the
character
of
the
species
,
at
least
in
its
adult
state
,
would
be
modified
;
nor
is
it
improbable
that
the
previous
and
earlier
stages
of
development
would
in
some
cases
be
hurried
through
and
finally
lost
.
Whether
species
have
often
or
ever
been
modified
through
this
comparatively
sudden
mode
of
transition
,
I
can
form
no
opinion
;
but
if
this
has
occurred
,
it
is
probable
that
the
differences
between
the
young
and
the
mature
,
and
between
the
mature
and
the
old
,
were
primordially
acquired
by
graduated
steps
.
Special
Difficulties
of
the
Theory
Of
Natural
Selection
Although
we
must
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
any
organ
could
not
have
been
produced
by
successive
,
small
,
transitional
gradations
,
yet
undoubtedly
serious
cases
of
difficulty
occur
.
One
of
the
most
serious
is
that
of
neuter
insects
,
which
are
often
differently
constructed
from
either
the
males
or
fertile
females
;
but
this
case
will
be
treated
of
in
the
next
chapter
.
The
electric
organs
of
fishes
offer
another
case
of
special
difficulty
;
for
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
by
,
what
steps
these
wondrous
organs
have
been
produced
.
But
this
is
not
surprising
,
for
we
do
not
even
know
of
what
use
they
are
.
In
the
Gymnotus
and
torpedo
they
no
doubt
serve
as
powerful
means
of
defence
,
and
perhaps
for
securing
prey
;
yet
in
the
ray
,
as
observed
by
Matteucci
,
an
analogous
organ
in
the
tail
manifests
but
little
electricity
,
even
when
the
animal
is
greatly
irritated
;
so
little
,
that
it
can
hardly
be
of
any
use
for
the
above
purposes
.
Moreover
,
in
the
ray
,
besides
the
organ
just
referred
to
,
there
is
,
as
Dr
.
R
.
McDonnell
has
shown
,
another
organ
near
the
head
,
not
known
to
be
electrical
,
but
which
appears
to
be
the
real
homologue
of
the
electric
battery
in
the
torpedo
.
It
is
generally
admitted
that
there
exists
between
these
organs
and
ordinary
muscle
a
close
analogy
,
in
intimate
structure
,
in
the
distribution
of
the
nerves
,
and
in
the
manner
in
which
they
are
acted
on
by
various
reagents
.
It
should
,
also
,
be
especially
observed
that
muscular
contraction
is
accompanied
by
an
electrical
discharge
;
and
,
as
Dr
.
Radcliffe
insists
,
"
in
the
electrical
apparatus
of
the
torpedo
during
rest
,
there
would
seem
be
a
charge
in
every
respect
like
that
which
is
met
with
in
muscle
and
nerve
during
rest
,
and
the
discharge
of
the
torpedo
,
instead
of
being
peculiar
,
may
be
only
another
form
of
the
discharge
which
depends
upon
the
action
of
muscle
and
motor
nerve
.
"
Beyond
this
we
cannot
at
present
go
in
the
way
of
explanation
;
but
as
we
know
so
little
about
the
uses
of
these
organs
,
and
as
we
know
nothing
about
the
habits
and
structure
of
the
progenitors
of
the
existing
electric
fishes
,
it
would
be
extremely
bold
to
maintain
that
no
serviceable
transitions
are
possible
by
which
these
organs
might
have
been
gradually
developed
.
These
organs
appear
at
first
to
offer
another
and
far
more
serious
difficulty
;
for
they
occur
in
about
a
dozen
kinds
of
fish
,
of
which
several
are
widely
remote
in
their
affinities
.
When
the
same
organ
is
found
in
several
members
of
the
same
class
,
especially
if
in
members
having
very
different
habits
of
life
,
we
may
generally
attribute
its
presence
to
inheritance
from
a
common
ancestor
;
and
its
absence
in
some
of
the
members
to
loss
through
disuse
or
natural
selection
.
So
that
,
if
the
electric
organs
had
been
inherited
from
some
one
ancient
progenitor
,
we
might
have
expected
that
all
electric
fishes
would
have
been
specially
related
to
each
other
;
but
this
is
far
from
the
case
.
Nor
does
geology
at
all
lead
to
the
belief
that
most
fishes
formerly
possessed
electric
organs
,
which
their
modified
descendants
have
now
lost
.
But
when
we
look
at
the
subject
more
closely
,
we
find
in
the
several
fishes
provided
with
electric
organs
,
that
these
are
situated
in
different
parts
of
the
body
,
that
they
differ
in
construction
,
as
in
the
arrangement
of
the
plates
,
and
,
according
to
Pacini
,
in
the
process
or
means
by
which
the
electricity
is
excited
and
lastly
,
in
being
supplied
with
nerves
proceeding
from
different
sources
,
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
the
differences
.
Hence
in
the
several
fishes
furnished
with
electric
organs
,
these
cannot
be
considered
as
homologous
,
but
only
as
analogous
in
function
.
Consequently
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
progenitor
;
for
had
this
been
the
case
they
would
have
closely
resembled
each
other
in
all
respects
.
Thus
the
difficulty
of
an
organ
,
apparently
the
same
,
arising
in
several
remotely
allied
species
,
disappears
,
leaving
only
the
lesser
yet
still
great
difficulty
;
namely
,
by
what
graduated
steps
these
organs
have
been
developed
in
each
separate
group
of
fishes
.
The
luminous
organs
which
occur
in
a
few
insects
,
belonging
to
widely
different
families
,
and
which
are
situated
in
different
parts
of
the
body
,
offer
,
under
our
present
state
of
ignorance
,
a
difficulty
almost
exactly
parallel
with
that
of
the
electric
organs
.
Other
similar
cases
could
be
given
;
for
instance
in
plants
,
the
very
curious
contrivance
of
a
mass
of
pollen
grains
,
borne
on
a
foot
stalk
with
an
adhesive
gland
,
is
apparently
the
same
in
Orchis
and
Asclepias
,
genera
almost
as
remote
as
is
possible
amongst
flowering
plants
;
but
here
again
the
parts
are
not
homologous
.
In
all
cases
of
beings
,
far
removed
from
each
other
in
the
scale
of
organisation
,
which
are
furnished
with
similar
and
peculiar
organs
,
it
will
be
found
that
although
the
general
appearance
and
function
of
the
organs
may
be
the
same
,
yet
fundamental
differences
between
them
can
always
be
detected
.
For
instance
,
the
eyes
of
cephalopods
or
cuttle
fish
and
of
vertebrate
animals
appear
wonderfully
alike
;
and
in
such
widely
sundered
groups
no
part
of
this
resemblance
can
be
due
to
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
.
Mr
.
Mivart
has
advanced
this
case
as
one
of
special
difficulty
,
but
I
am
unable
to
see
the
force
of
his
argument
.
An
organ
for
vision
must
be
formed
of
transparent
tissue
,
and
must
include
some
sort
of
lens
for
throwing
an
image
at
the
back
of
a
darkened
chamber
.
Beyond
this
superficial
resemblance
,
there
is
hardly
any
real
similarity
between
the
eyes
of
cuttle
fish
and
vertebrates
,
as
may
be
seen
by
consulting
Hensen's
admirable
memoir
on
these
organs
in
the
Cephalopoda
.
It
is
impossible
for
me
here
to
enter
on
details
,
but
I
may
specify
a
few
of
the
points
of
difference
.
The
crystalline
lens
in
the
higher
cuttle
fish
consists
of
two
parts
,
placed
one
behind
the
other
like
two
lenses
,
both
having
a
very
different
structure
and
disposition
to
what
occurs
in
the
vertebrata
.
The
retina
is
wholly
different
,
with
an
actual
inversion
of
the
elemental
parts
,
and
with
a
large
nervous
ganglion
included
within
the
membranes
of
the
eye
.
The
relations
of
the
muscles
are
as
different
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
,
and
so
in
other
points
.
Hence
it
is
not
a
little
difficult
to
decide
how
far
even
the
same
terms
ought
to
be
employed
in
describing
the
eyes
of
the
Cephalopoda
and
Vertebrata
.
It
is
,
of
course
,
open
to
any
one
to
deny
that
the
eye
in
either
case
could
have
been
developed
through
the
natural
selection
of
successive
slight
variations
;
but
if
this
be
admitted
in
the
one
case
,
it
is
clearly
possible
in
the
other
;
and
fundamental
differences
of
structure
in
the
visual
organs
of
two
groups
might
have
been
anticipated
,
in
accordance
with
this
view
of
their
manner
of
formation
.
As
two
men
have
sometimes
independently
hit
on
the
same
invention
,
so
in
the
several
foregoing
cases
it
appears
that
natural
selection
,
working
for
the
good
of
each
being
,
and
taking
advantage
of
all
favourable
variations
,
has
produced
similar
organs
,
as
far
as
function
is
concerned
,
in
distinct
organic
beings
,
which
owe
none
of
their
structure
in
common
to
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
.
Fritz
Muller
,
in
order
to
test
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in
this
volume
,
has
followed
out
with
much
care
a
nearly
similar
line
of
argument
.
Several
families
of
crustaceans
include
a
few
species
,
possessing
an
air
breathing
apparatus
and
fitted
to
live
out
of
the
water
.
In
two
of
these
families
,
which
were
more
especially
examined
by
Muller
and
which
are
nearly
related
to
each
other
,
the
species
agree
most
closely
in
all
important
characters
;
namely
,
in
their
sense
organs
,
circulating
system
,
in
the
position
of
the
tufts
of
hair
within
their
complex
stomachs
,
and
lastly
in
the
whole
structure
of
the
water
breathing
branchiae
,
even
to
the
microscopical
hooks
by
which
they
are
cleansed
.
Hence
it
might
have
been
expected
that
in
the
few
species
belonging
to
both
families
which
live
on
the
land
,
the
equally
important
air
breathing
apparatus
would
have
been
the
same
;
for
why
should
this
one
apparatus
,
given
for
the
same
purpose
,
have
been
made
to
differ
,
whilst
all
the
other
important
organs
were
closely
similar
or
rather
identical
?
Fritz
Muller
argues
that
this
close
similarity
in
so
many
points
of
structure
must
,
in
accordance
with
the
views
advanced
by
me
,
be
accounted
for
by
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
.
But
as
the
vast
majority
of
the
species
in
the
above
two
families
,
as
well
as
most
other
crustaceans
,
are
aquatic
in
their
habits
,
it
is
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
,
that
their
common
progenitor
should
have
been
adapted
for
breathing
air
was
thus
led
carefully
to
examine
the
apparatus
in
the
air
breathing
species
;
and
he
found
it
to
differ
in
each
in
several
important
points
,
as
in
the
position
of
the
orifices
,
in
the
manner
in
which
they
are
opened
and
closed
,
and
in
some
accessory
details
.
Now
such
differences
are
intelligible
,
and
might
even
have
been
expected
,
on
the
supposition
that
species
belonging
to
distinct
families
had
slowly
become
adapted
to
live
more
and
more
out
of
water
,
and
to
breathe
the
air
.
For
these
species
,
from
belonging
to
distinct
families
,
would
have
differed
to
a
certain
extent
,
and
in
accordance
with
the
principle
that
the
nature
of
each
variation
depends
on
two
factors
,
viz
.
,
the
nature
of
the
organism
and
that
of
the
surrounding
conditions
,
their
variability
assuredly
would
not
have
been
exactly
the
same
.
Consequently
natural
selection
would
have
had
different
materials
or
variations
to
work
on
,
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
same
functional
result
;
and
the
structures
thus
acquired
would
almost
necessarily
have
differed
.
On
the
hypothesis
of
separate
acts
of
creation
the
whole
case
remains
unintelligible
.
This
line
of
argument
seems
to
have
had
great
weight
in
leading
Fritz
Muller
to
accept
the
views
maintained
by
me
in
this
volume
.
Another
distinguished
zoologist
,
the
late
Professor
Claparide
,
has
argued
in
the
same
manner
,
and
has
arrived
at
the
same
result
.
He
shows
that
there
are
parasitic
mites
(
Acaridae
)
,
belonging
to
distinct
sub
families
and
families
,
which
are
furnished
with
hair
claspers
.
These
organs
must
have
been
independently
developed
,
as
they
could
not
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
progenitor
;
and
in
the
several
groups
they
are
formed
by
the
modification
of
the
fore
legs
,
of
the
hind
legs
,
of
the
maxillae
or
lips
,
and
of
appendages
on
the
under
side
of
the
hind
part
of
the
body
.
In
the
foregoing
cases
,
we
see
the
same
end
gained
and
the
same
function
performed
,
in
beings
not
at
all
or
only
remotely
allied
,
by
organs
in
appearance
,
though
not
in
development
,
closely
similar
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
a
common
rule
throughout
nature
that
the
same
end
should
be
gained
,
even
sometimes
in
the
case
of
closely
related
beings
,
by
the
most
diversified
means
.
How
differently
constructed
is
the
feathered
wing
of
a
bird
and
the
membrane
covered
wing
of
a
bat
;
and
still
more
so
the
four
wings
of
a
butterfly
,
the
two
wings
of
a
fly
,
and
the
two
wings
with
the
elytra
of
a
beetle
.
Bivalve
shells
are
made
to
open
and
shut
,
but
on
what
a
number
of
patterns
is
the
hinge
constructed
,
from
the
long
row
of
neatly
interlocking
teeth
in
a
Nucula
to
the
simple
ligament
of
a
Mussel!
Seeds
are
disseminated
by
their
minuteness
,
by
their
capsule
being
converted
into
a
light
balloon
like
envelope
,
by
being
embedded
in
pulp
or
flesh
,
formed
of
the
most
diverse
parts
,
and
rendered
nutritious
,
as
well
as
conspicuously
coloured
,
so
as
to
attract
and
be
devoured
by
birds
,
by
having
hooks
and
grapnels
of
many
kinds
and
serrated
arms
,
so
as
to
adhere
to
the
fur
of
quadrupeds
,
and
by
being
furnished
with
wings
and
plumes
,
as
different
in
shape
as
they
are
elegant
in
structure
,
so
as
to
be
wafted
by
every
breeze
.
I
will
give
one
other
instance
;
for
this
subject
of
the
same
end
being
gained
by
the
most
diversified
means
well
deserves
attention
.
Some
authors
maintain
that
organic
beings
have
been
formed
in
many
ways
for
the
sake
of
mere
variety
,
almost
like
toys
in
a
shop
,
but
such
a
view
of
nature
is
incredible
.
With
plants
having
separated
sexes
,
and
with
those
in
which
,
though
hermaphrodites
,
the
pollen
does
not
spontaneously
fall
on
the
stigma
,
some
aid
is
necessary
for
their
fertilisation
.
With
several
kinds
this
is
effected
by
the
pollen
grains
,
which
are
light
and
incoherent
,
being
blown
by
the
wind
through
mere
chance
on
to
the
stigma
;
and
this
is
the
simplest
plan
which
can
well
be
conceived
.
An
almost
equally
simple
,
though
very
different
,
plan
occurs
in
many
plants
in
which
a
symmetrical
flower
secretes
a
few
drops
of
nectar
,
and
is
consequently
visited
by
insects
;
and
these
carry
the
pollen
from
the
anthers
to
the
stigma
.
From
this
simple
stage
we
may
pass
through
an
inexhaustible
number
of
contrivances
,
all
for
the
same
purpose
and
effected
in
essentially
the
same
manner
,
but
entailing
changes
in
every
part
of
the
flower
.
The
nectar
may
be
stored
in
variously
shaped
receptacles
,
with
the
stamens
and
pistils
modified
in
many
ways
,
sometimes
forming
trap
like
contrivances
,
and
sometimes
capable
of
neatly
adapted
movements
through
irritability
or
elasticity
.
From
such
structures
we
may
advance
till
we
come
to
such
a
case
of
extraordinary
adaptation
as
that
lately
described
by
Dr
.
Cruger
in
the
Coryanthes
.
This
orchid
has
part
of
its
labellum
or
lower
lip
hollowed
out
into
a
great
bucket
,
into
which
drops
of
almost
pure
water
continually
fall
from
two
secreting
horns
which
stand
above
it
;
and
when
the
bucket
is
half
full
,
the
water
overflows
by
a
spout
on
one
side
.
The
basal
part
of
the
labellum
stands
over
the
bucket
,
and
is
itself
hollowed
out
into
a
sort
of
chamber
with
two
lateral
entrances
;
within
this
chamber
there
are
curious
fleshy
ridges
.
The
most
ingenious
man
,
if
he
had
not
witnessed
what
takes
place
,
could
never
have
imagined
what
purpose
all
these
parts
serve
.
But
Dr
.
Cruger
saw
crowds
of
large
humble
bees
visiting
the
gigantic
flowers
of
this
orchid
,
not
in
order
to
suck
nectar
,
but
to
gnaw
off
the
ridges
within
the
chamber
above
the
bucket
;
in
doing
this
they
frequently
pushed
each
other
into
the
bucket
,
and
their
wings
being
thus
wetted
they
could
not
fly
away
,
but
were
compelled
to
crawl
out
through
the
passage
formed
by
the
spout
or
overflow
.
Dr
.
Cruger
saw
a
"
continual
procession
"
of
bees
thus
crawling
out
of
their
involuntary
bath
.
The
passage
is
narrow
,
and
is
roofed
over
by
the
column
,
so
that
a
bee
,
in
forcing
its
way
out
,
first
rubs
its
back
against
the
viscid
stigma
and
then
against
the
viscid
glands
of
the
pollen
masses
.
The
pollen
masses
are
thus
glued
to
the
back
of
the
be
which
first
happens
to
crawl
out
through
the
passage
of
a
lately
expanded
flower
,
and
are
thus
carried
away
.
Dr
.
Cruger
sent
me
a
flower
in
spirits
of
wine
,
with
a
bee
which
he
had
killed
before
it
had
quite
crawled
out
with
a
pollen
mass
still
fastened
to
its
back
.
When
the
bee
,
thus
provided
,
flies
to
another
flower
,
or
to
the
same
flower
a
second
time
,
and
is
pushed
by
its
comrades
into
the
bucket
and
then
crawls
out
by
the
passage
,
the
pollen
mass
necessarily
comes
first
into
contact
with
the
viscid
stigma
,
and
adheres
to
it
,
and
the
flower
is
fertilised
.
Now
at
last
we
see
the
full
use
of
every
part
of
the
flower
,
of
the
water
secreting
horns
,
of
the
bucket
half
full
of
water
,
which
prevents
the
bees
from
flying
away
,
and
forces
them
to
crawl
out
through
the
spout
,
and
rub
against
the
properly
placed
viscid
pollen
masses
and
the
viscid
stigma
.
The
construction
of
the
flower
in
another
closely
allied
orchid
,
namely
the
Catasetum
,
is
widely
different
,
though
serving
the
same
end
;
and
is
equally
curious
.
Bees
visit
these
flowers
,
like
those
of
the
Coryanthes
,
in
order
to
gnaw
the
labellum
;
in
doing
this
they
inevitably
touch
a
long
,
tapering
,
sensitive
projection
,
or
,
as
I
have
called
it
,
the
antenna
.
This
antenna
,
when
touched
,
transmits
a
sensation
or
vibration
to
a
certain
membrane
which
is
instantly
ruptured
;
this
sets
free
a
spring
by
which
the
pollen
mass
is
shot
forth
,
like
an
arrow
,
in
the
right
direction
,
and
adheres
by
its
viscid
extremity
to
the
back
of
the
bee
.
The
pollen
mass
of
the
male
plant
(
for
the
sexes
are
separate
in
this
orchid
)
is
thus
carried
to
the
flower
of
the
female
plant
where
it
is
brought
into
contact
with
the
stigma
,
which
is
viscid
enough
to
break
certain
elastic
threads
,
and
retaining
the
pollen
,
fertilisation
is
effected
.
How
,
it
may
be
asked
,
in
the
foregoing
and
in
innumerable
other
instances
,
can
we
understand
the
graduated
scale
of
complexity
and
the
multifarious
means
for
gaining
the
same
end
.
The
answer
no
doubt
is
,
as
already
remarked
,
that
when
two
forms
vary
,
which
already
differ
from
each
other
in
some
slight
degree
,
the
variability
will
not
be
of
the
same
exact
nature
,
and
consequently
the
results
obtained
through
natural
selection
for
the
same
general
purpose
will
not
be
the
same
.
We
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
every
highly
developed
organism
has
passed
through
many
changes
;
and
that
each
modified
structure
tends
to
be
inherited
,
so
that
each
modification
will
not
readily
be
quite
lost
,
but
may
be
again
and
again
further
altered
.
Hence
the
structure
of
each
part
of
each
species
,
for
whatever
purpose
it
may
serve
,
is
the
sum
of
many
inherited
changes
,
through
which
the
species
has
passed
during
its
successive
adaptations
to
changed
habits
and
conditions
of
life
.
Finally
then
,
although
in
many
cases
it
is
most
difficult
even
to
conjecture
by
what
transitions
organs
have
arrived
at
their
present
state
;
yet
,
considering
how
small
the
proportion
of
living
and
known
forms
is
to
the
extinct
and
unknown
,
I
have
been
astonished
how
rarely
an
organ
can
be
named
,
towards
which
no
transitional
grade
is
known
to
lead
.
It
certainly
is
true
,
that
new
organs
appearing
as
if
created
for
some
special
purpose
,
rarely
or
never
appear
in
any
being
;
as
indeed
is
shown
by
that
old
,
but
somewhat
exaggerated
,
canon
in
natural
history
of
"
Natura
non
facit
saltum
.
"
We
meet
with
this
admission
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
experienced
naturalist
;
or
as
Milne
Edwards
has
well
expressed
it
,
Nature
is
prodigal
in
variety
,
but
niggard
in
innovation
.
Why
,
on
the
theory
of
Creation
,
should
there
be
so
much
variety
and
so
little
real
novelty
?
Why
should
all
the
parts
and
organs
of
many
independent
beings
,
each
supposed
to
have
been
separately
created
for
its
proper
place
in
nature
,
be
so
commonly
linked
together
by
graduated
steps
?
Why
should
not
Nature
take
a
sudden
leap
from
structure
to
structure
?
On
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
we
can
clearly
understand
why
she
should
not
;
for
natural
selection
acts
only
by
taking
advantage
of
slight
successive
variations
;
she
can
never
take
a
great
and
sudden
leap
,
but
must
advance
by
short
and
sure
,
though
slow
steps
.
Organs
of
little
apparent
Importance
,
as
affected
by
Natural
Selection
As
natural
selection
acts
by
life
and
death
,
by
the
survival
of
the
fittest
,
and
by
the
destruction
of
the
less
well
fitted
individuals
,
I
have
sometimes
felt
great
difficulty
in
understanding
the
origin
or
formation
of
parts
of
little
importance
;
almost
as
great
,
though
of
a
very
different
kind
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
most
perfect
and
complex
organs
.
In
the
first
place
,
we
are
much
too
ignorant
in
regard
to
the
whole
economy
of
any
one
organic
being
,
to
say
what
slight
modifications
would
be
of
importance
or
not
.
In
a
former
chapter
I
have
given
instances
of
very
trifling
characters
,
such
as
the
down
on
fruit
and
the
colour
of
its
flesh
,
the
colour
of
the
skin
and
hair
of
quadrupeds
,
which
,
from
being
correlated
with
constitutional
differences
or
from
determining
the
attacks
of
insects
,
might
assuredly
be
acted
on
by
natural
selection
.
The
tail
of
the
giraffe
looks
like
an
artificially
constructed
fly
flapper
;
and
it
seems
at
first
incredible
that
this
could
have
been
adapted
for
its
present
purpose
by
successive
slight
modifications
,
each
better
and
better
fitted
,
for
so
trifling
an
object
as
to
drive
away
flies
;
yet
we
should
pause
before
being
too
positive
even
in
this
case
,
for
we
know
that
the
distribution
and
existence
of
cattle
and
other
animals
in
South
America
absolutely
depend
on
their
power
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
insects
:
so
that
individuals
which
could
by
any
means
defend
themselves
from
these
small
enemies
,
would
be
able
to
range
into
new
pastures
and
thus
gain
a
great
advantage
.
It
is
not
that
the
larger
quadrupeds
are
actually
destroyed
(
except
in
some
rare
cases
)
by
flies
,
but
they
are
incessantly
harassed
and
their
strength
reduced
,
so
that
they
are
more
subject
to
disease
,
or
not
so
well
enabled
in
a
coming
dearth
to
search
for
food
,
or
to
escape
from
beasts
of
prey
.
Organs
now
of
trifling
importance
have
probably
in
some
cases
been
of
high
importance
to
an
early
progenitor
,
and
,
after
having
been
slowly
perfected
at
a
former
period
,
have
been
transmitted
to
existing
species
in
nearly
the
same
state
,
although
now
of
very
slight
use
;
but
any
actually
injurious
deviations
in
their
structure
would
of
course
have
been
checked
by
natural
selection
.
Seeing
how
important
an
organ
of
locomotion
the
tail
is
in
most
aquatic
animals
,
its
general
presence
and
use
for
many
purposes
in
so
many
land
animals
,
which
in
their
lungs
or
modified
swimbladders
betray
their
aquatic
origin
,
may
perhaps
be
thus
accounted
for
.
A
well
developed
tail
having
been
formed
in
an
aquatic
animal
,
it
might
subsequently
come
to
be
worked
in
for
all
sorts
of
purposes
,
as
a
fly
flapper
,
an
organ
of
prehension
,
or
as
an
aid
in
turning
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
dog
,
though
the
aid
in
this
latter
respect
must
be
slight
,
for
the
hare
,
with
hardly
any
tail
,
can
double
still
more
quickly
.
In
the
second
place
,
we
may
easily
err
in
attributing
importance
to
characters
,
and
in
believing
that
they
have
been
developed
through
natural
selection
.
We
must
by
no
means
overlook
the
effects
of
the
definite
action
of
changed
conditions
of
life
,
of
so
called
spontaneous
variations
,
which
seem
to
depend
in
a
quite
subordinate
degree
on
the
nature
of
the
conditions
,
of
the
tendency
to
reversion
to
long
lost
characters
,
of
the
complex
laws
of
growth
,
such
as
of
correlation
,
compensation
,
of
the
pressure
of
one
part
on
another
,
&c
.
,
and
finally
of
sexual
selection
,
by
which
characters
of
use
to
one
sex
are
often
gained
and
then
transmitted
more
or
less
perfectly
to
the
other
sex
,
though
of
no
use
to
this
sex
.
But
structures
thus
indirectly
gained
,
although
at
first
of
no
advantage
to
a
species
,
may
subsequently
have
been
taken
advantage
of
by
its
modified
descendants
,
under
new
conditions
of
life
and
newly
acquired
habits
.
If
green
woodpeckers
alone
had
existed
,
and
we
did
not
know
that
there
were
many
black
and
pied
kinds
,
I
dare
say
that
we
should
have
thought
that
the
green
colour
was
a
beautiful
adaptation
to
conceal
this
tree
frequenting
bird
from
its
enemies
;
and
consequently
that
it
was
a
character
of
importance
,
and
had
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
;
as
it
is
,
the
colour
is
probably
in
chief
part
due
to
sexual
selection
.
A
trailing
palm
in
the
Malay
Archipelago
climbs
the
loftiest
trees
by
the
aid
of
exquisitely
constructed
hooks
clustered
around
the
ends
of
the
branches
,
and
this
contrivance
,
no
doubt
,
is
of
the
highest
service
to
the
plant
;
but
as
we
see
nearly
similar
hooks
on
many
trees
which
are
not
climbers
,
and
which
,
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
from
the
distribution
of
the
thorn
bearing
species
in
Africa
and
South
America
,
serve
as
a
defence
against
browsing
quadrupeds
,
so
the
spikes
on
the
palm
may
at
first
have
been
developed
for
this
object
,
and
subsequently
have
been
improved
and
taken
advantage
of
by
the
plant
,
as
it
underwent
further
modification
and
became
a
climber
.
The
naked
skin
on
the
head
of
a
vulture
is
generally
considered
as
a
direct
adaptation
for
wallowing
in
putridity
;
and
so
it
may
be
,
or
it
may
possibly
be
due
to
the
direct
action
of
putrid
matter
;
but
we
should
be
very
cautious
in
drawing
any
such
inference
,
when
we
see
that
the
skin
on
the
head
of
the
clean
feeding
male
turkey
is
likewise
naked
.
The
sutures
in
the
skull
?
of
young
mammals
have
been
advanced
as
a
beautiful
adaptation
for
aiding
parturition
,
and
no
doubt
they
facilitate
,
or
may
be
indispensable
for
this
act
;
but
as
sutures
occur
in
the
skulls
of
young
birds
and
reptiles
,
which
have
only
to
escape
from
a
broken
egg
,
we
may
infer
that
this
structure
has
arisen
from
the
laws
of
growth
,
and
has
been
taken
advantage
of
in
the
parturition
of
the
higher
animals
.
We
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
each
slight
variation
or
individual
difference
;
and
we
are
immediately
made
conscious
of
this
by
reflecting
on
the
differences
between
the
breeds
of
our
domesticated
animals
in
different
countries
,
more
especially
in
the
less
civilised
countries
where
there
has
been
but
little
methodical
selection
.
Animals
kept
by
savages
in
different
countries
often
have
to
struggle
for
their
own
subsistence
,
and
are
exposed
to
a
certain
extent
to
natural
selection
,
and
individuals
with
slightly
different
constitutions
would
succeed
best
under
different
climates
.
With
cattle
susceptibility
to
the
attacks
of
flies
is
correlated
with
colour
,
as
is
the
liability
to
be
poisoned
by
certain
plants
;
so
that
even
colour
would
be
thus
subjected
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
.
Some
observers
are
convinced
that
a
damp
climate
affects
the
growth
of
the
hair
,
and
that
with
the
hair
the
horns
are
correlated
.
Mountain
breeds
always
differ
from
lowland
breeds
;
and
a
mountainous
country
would
probably
affect
the
hind
limbs
from
exercising
them
more
,
and
possibly
even
the
form
of
the
pelvis
;
and
then
by
the
law
of
homologous
variation
,
the
front
limbs
and
the
head
would
probably
be
affected
.
The
shape
,
also
,
of
the
pelvis
might
affect
by
pressure
the
shape
of
certain
parts
of
the
young
in
the
womb
.
The
laborious
breathing
necessary
in
high
regions
tends
,
as
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
,
to
increase
the
size
of
the
chest
;
and
again
correlation
would
come
into
play
.
The
effects
of
lessened
exercise
together
with
abundant
food
on
the
whole
organisation
is
probably
still
more
important
;
and
this
,
as
H
.
von
Nathusius
has
lately
shown
in
his
excellent
treatise
,
is
apparently
one
chief
cause
of
the
great
modification
which
the
breeds
of
swine
have
undergone
.
But
we
are
far
too
ignorant
to
speculate
on
the
relative
importance
of
the
several
known
and
unknown
causes
of
variation
;
and
I
have
made
these
remarks
only
to
show
that
,
if
we
are
unable
to
account
for
the
characteristic
differences
of
our
several
domestic
breeds
,
which
nevertheless
are
generally
admitted
to
have
arisen
through
ordinary
generation
from
one
or
a
few
parent
stocks
,
we
ought
not
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
our
ignorance
of
the
precise
cause
of
the
slight
analogous
differences
between
true
species
.
Utilitarian
Doctrine
,
how
far
true
:
Beauty
,
how
acquired
.
The
foregoing
remarks
lead
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
protest
lately
made
by
some
naturalists
,
against
the
utilitarian
doctrine
that
every
detail
of
structure
has
been
produced
for
the
good
of
its
possessor
.
They
believe
that
many
structures
have
been
created
for
the
sake
of
beauty
,
to
delight
man
or
the
Creator
(
but
this
latter
point
is
beyond
the
scope
of
scientific
discussion
)
,
or
for
the
sake
of
mere
variety
,
a
view
already
discussed
.
Such
doctrines
,
if
true
,
would
be
absolutely
fatal
to
my
theory
.
I
fully
admit
that
many
structures
are
now
of
no
direct
use
to
their
possessors
,
and
may
never
have
been
of
any
use
to
their
progenitors
;
but
this
does
not
prove
that
they
were
formed
solely
for
beauty
or
variety
.
No
doubt
the
definite
action
of
changed
conditions
,
and
the
various
causes
of
modifications
,
lately
specified
,
have
all
produced
an
effect
,
probably
a
great
effect
,
independently
of
any
advantage
thus
gained
.
But
a
still
more
important
consideration
is
that
the
chief
part
of
the
organisation
of
every
living
creature
is
due
to
inheritance
;
and
consequently
,
though
each
being
assuredly
is
well
fitted
for
its
place
in
nature
,
many
structures
have
now
no
very
close
and
direct
relation
to
present
habits
of
life
.
Thus
,
we
can
hardly
believe
that
the
webbed
feet
of
the
upland
goose
or
of
the
frigate
bird
are
of
special
use
to
these
birds
;
we
cannot
believe
that
the
similar
bones
in
the
arm
of
the
monkey
,
in
the
fore
leg
of
the
horse
,
in
the
wing
of
the
bat
,
and
in
the
flipper
of
the
seal
,
are
of
special
use
to
these
animals
.
We
may
safely
attribute
these
structures
to
inheritance
.
But
webbed
feet
no
doubt
were
as
useful
to
the
progenitor
of
the
upland
goose
and
of
the
frigate
bird
,
as
they
now
are
to
the
most
aquatic
of
living
birds
.
So
we
may
believe
that
the
progenitor
of
the
seal
did
not
possess
a
flipper
,
but
a
foot
with
five
toes
fitted
for
walking
or
grasping
;
but
we
may
further
venture
to
believe
that
the
several
bones
in
the
limbs
of
the
monkey
,
horse
,
and
bat
,
were
originally
developed
,
on
the
principle
of
utility
,
probably
through
the
reduction
of
more
numerous
bones
in
the
fin
of
some
ancient
fish
like
progenitor
of
the
whole
class
.
It
is
scarcely
possible
to
decide
how
much
allowance
ought
to
be
made
for
such
causes
of
change
,
as
the
definite
action
of
external
conditions
,
so
called
spontaneous
variations
,
and
the
complex
laws
of
growth
;
but
with
these
important
exceptions
,
we
may
conclude
that
the
structure
of
every
living
creature
either
now
is
,
or
was
formerly
,
of
some
direct
or
indirect
use
to
its
possessor
.
With
respect
to
the
belief
that
organic
beings
have
been
created
beautiful
for
the
delight
of
man
,
a
belief
which
it
has
been
pronounced
is
subversive
of
my
whole
theory
,
I
may
first
remark
that
the
sense
of
beauty
obviously
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
mind
,
irrespective
of
any
real
quality
in
the
admired
object
;
and
that
the
idea
of
what
is
beautiful
,
is
not
innate
or
unalterable
.
We
see
this
,
for
instance
,
in
the
men
of
different
races
admiring
an
entirely
different
standard
of
beauty
in
their
women
.
If
beautiful
objects
had
been
created
solely
for
man's
gratification
,
it
ought
to
be
shown
that
before
man
appeared
,
there
was
less
beauty
on
the
face
of
the
earth
than
since
he
came
on
the
stage
.
Were
the
beautiful
volute
and
cone
shells
of
the
Eocene
epoch
,
and
the
gracefully
sculptured
ammonites
of
the
Secondary
period
,
created
that
man
might
ages
afterwards
admire
them
in
his
cabinet
?
Few
objects
are
more
beautiful
than
the
minute
siliceous
cases
of
the
diatomaceae
:
were
these
created
that
they
might
be
examined
and
admired
under
the
higher
powers
of
the
microscope
?
The
beauty
in
this
latter
case
,
and
in
many
others
,
is
apparently
wholly
due
to
symmetry
of
growth
.
Flowers
rank
amongst
the
most
beautiful
productions
of
nature
;
but
they
have
been
rendered
conspicuous
in
contrast
with
the
green
leaves
,
and
in
consequence
at
the
same
time
beautiful
,
so
that
they
may
be
easily
observed
by
insects
.
I
have
come
to
this
conclusion
from
finding
it
an
invariable
rule
that
when
a
flower
is
fertilised
by
the
wind
it
never
has
a
gaily
coloured
corolla
.
Several
plants
habitually
produce
two
kinds
of
flowers
;
one
kind
open
and
coloured
so
as
to
attract
insects
;
the
other
closed
,
not
coloured
,
destitute
of
nectar
,
and
never
visited
by
insects
.
Hence
we
may
conclude
that
,
if
insects
had
not
been
developed
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
our
plants
would
not
have
been
decked
with
beautiful
flowers
,
but
would
have
produced
only
such
poor
flowers
as
we
see
on
our
fir
,
oak
,
nut
and
ash
trees
,
on
grasses
,
spinach
,
docks
,
and
nettles
,
which
are
all
fertilised
through
the
agency
of
the
wind
.
A
similar
line
of
argument
holds
good
with
fruits
;
that
a
ripe
strawberry
or
cherry
is
as
pleasing
to
the
eye
as
to
the
palate
,
that
the
gaily
coloured
fruit
of
the
spindle
wood
tree
and
the
scarlet
berries
of
the
holly
are
beautiful
objects
,
will
be
admitted
by
every
one
.
But
this
beauty
serves
merely
as
a
guide
to
birds
and
beasts
,
in
order
that
the
fruit
may
be
devoured
and
the
matured
seeds
disseminated
:
I
infer
that
this
is
the
case
from
having
as
yet
found
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
seeds
are
always
thus
disseminated
when
embedded
within
a
fruit
of
any
kind
(
that
is
within
a
fleshy
or
pulpy
envelope
)
,
if
it
be
coloured
of
any
brilliant
tint
,
or
rendered
conspicuous
by
being
white
or
black
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
willingly
admit
that
a
great
number
of
male
animals
,
as
all
our
most
gorgeous
birds
,
some
fishes
,
reptiles
,
and
mammals
,
and
a
host
of
magnificently
coloured
butterflies
,
have
been
rendered
beautiful
for
beauty's
sake
;
but
this
has
been
effected
through
sexual
selection
,
that
is
,
by
the
more
beautiful
males
having
been
continually
preferred
by
the
females
,
and
not
for
the
delight
of
man
.
So
it
is
with
the
music
of
birds
.
We
may
infer
from
all
this
that
a
nearly
similar
taste
for
beautiful
colours
and
for
musical
sounds
runs
through
a
large
part
of
the
animal
kingdom
.
When
the
female
is
as
beautifully
coloured
as
the
male
,
which
is
not
rarely
the
case
with
birds
and
butterflies
,
the
cause
apparently
lies
in
the
colours
acquired
through
sexual
selection
having
been
transmitted
to
both
sexes
,
instead
of
to
the
males
alone
.
How
the
sense
of
beauty
in
its
simplest
form
that
is
,
the
reception
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
pleasure
from
certain
colours
,
forms
,
and
sounds
was
first
developed
in
the
mind
of
man
and
of
the
lower
animals
,
is
a
very
obscure
subject
.
The
same
sort
of
difficulty
is
presented
,
if
we
enquire
how
it
is
that
certain
flavours
and
odours
give
pleasure
,
and
others
displeasure
.
Habit
in
all
these
cases
appears
to
have
come
to
a
certain
extent
into
play
;
but
there
must
be
some
fundamental
cause
in
the
constitution
of
the
nervous
system
in
each
species
.
Natural
selection
cannot
possibly
produce
any
modification
in
a
species
exclusively
for
the
good
of
another
species
;
though
throughout
nature
one
species
incessantly
takes
advantage
of
,
and
profits
by
,
the
structures
of
others
.
But
natural
selection
can
and
does
often
produce
structures
for
the
direct
injury
of
other
animals
,
as
we
see
in
the
fang
of
the
adder
,
and
in
the
ovipositor
of
the
ichneumon
,
by
which
its
eggs
are
deposited
in
the
living
bodies
of
other
insects
.
If
it
could
be
proved
that
any
part
of
the
structure
of
any
one
species
had
been
formed
for
the
exclusive
good
of
another
species
,
it
would
annihilate
my
theory
,
for
such
could
not
have
been
produced
through
natural
selection
.
Although
many
statements
may
be
found
in
works
on
natural
history
to
this
effect
,
I
cannot
find
even
one
which
seems
to
me
of
any
weight
.
It
is
admitted
that
the
rattlesnake
has
a
poison
fang
for
its
own
defence
,
and
for
the
destruction
of
its
prey
;
but
some
authors
suppose
that
at
the
same
time
it
is
furnished
with
a
rattle
for
its
own
injury
,
namely
,
to
warn
its
prey
.
I
would
almost
as
soon
believe
that
the
cat
curls
the
end
of
its
tail
when
preparing
to
spring
,
in
order
to
warn
the
doomed
mouse
.
It
is
a
much
more
probable
view
that
the
rattlesnake
uses
its
rattle
,
the
cobra
expands
its
frill
,
and
the
puff
adder
swells
whilst
hissing
so
loudly
and
harshly
,
in
order
to
alarm
the
many
birds
and
beasts
which
are
known
to
attack
even
the
most
venomous
species
.
Snakes
act
on
the
same
principle
which
makes
the
hen
ruffle
her
feathers
and
expand
her
wings
when
a
dog
approaches
her
chickens
;
but
I
have
not
space
here
to
enlarge
on
the
many
ways
by
which
animals
endeavour
to
frighten
away
their
enemies
.
Natural
selection
will
never
produce
in
a
being
any
structure
more
injurious
than
beneficial
to
that
being
,
for
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
.
No
organ
will
be
formed
,
as
Paley
has
remarked
,
for
the
purpose
of
causing
pain
or
for
doing
an
injury
to
its
possessor
.
If
a
fair
balance
be
struck
between
the
good
and
evil
caused
by
each
part
,
each
will
be
found
on
the
whole
advantageous
.
After
the
lapse
of
time
,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
,
if
any
part
comes
to
be
injurious
,
it
will
be
modified
;
or
if
it
be
not
so
,
the
being
Will
become
extinct
as
myriads
have
become
extinct
.
Natural
selection
tends
only
to
make
each
organic
being
as
perfect
as
,
or
slightly
more
perfect
than
,
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
same
country
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
.
And
we
see
that
this
is
the
standard
of
perfection
attained
under
nature
.
The
endemic
productions
of
New
Zealand
,
for
instance
,
are
perfect
one
compared
with
another
;
but
they
are
now
rapidly
yielding
before
the
advancing
legions
of
plants
and
animals
introduced
from
Europe
.
Natural
selection
will
not
produce
absolute
perfection
,
nor
do
we
always
meet
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
with
this
high
standard
under
nature
.
The
correction
for
the
aberration
of
light
is
said
by
Muller
not
to
be
perfect
even
in
that
most
perfect
organ
,
the
human
eye
.
Helmholtz
,
whose
judgment
no
one
will
dispute
,
after
describing
in
the
strongest
terms
the
wonderful
powers
of
the
human
eye
,
adds
these
remarkable
words
:
"
That
which
we
have
discovered
in
the
way
of
inexactness
and
imperfection
in
the
optical
machine
and
in
the
image
on
the
retina
,
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
incongruities
which
we
have
just
come
across
in
the
domain
of
the
sensations
.
One
might
say
that
nature
has
taken
delight
in
accumulating
contradictions
in
order
to
remove
all
foundation
from
the
theory
of
a
pre
existing
harmony
between
the
external
and
internal
worlds
.
"
If
our
reason
leads
us
to
admire
with
enthusiasm
a
multitude
of
inimitable
contrivances
in
nature
,
this
same
reason
tells
us
,
though
we
may
easily
err
on
both
sides
,
that
some
other
contrivances
are
less
perfect
.
Can
we
consider
the
sting
of
the
bee
as
perfect
,
which
,
when
used
against
many
kinds
of
enemies
,
cannot
be
withdrawn
,
owing
to
the
backward
serratures
,
and
thus
inevitably
causes
the
death
of
the
insect
by
tearing
out
its
viscera
?
If
we
look
at
the
sting
of
the
bee
,
as
having
existed
in
a
remote
progenitor
,
as
a
boring
and
serrated
instrument
,
like
that
in
so
many
members
of
the
same
great
order
,
and
which
has
since
been
modified
but
not
perfected
for
its
present
purpose
,
with
the
poison
originally
adapted
for
some
other
object
,
such
as
to
produce
galls
,
since
intensified
,
we
can
perhaps
understand
how
it
is
that
the
use
of
the
sting
should
so
often
cause
the
insect's
own
death
:
for
if
on
the
whole
the
power
of
stinging
be
useful
to
the
social
community
,
it
will
fulfil
all
the
requirements
of
natural
selection
,
though
it
may
cause
the
death
of
some
few
members
.
If
we
admire
the
truly
wonderful
power
of
scent
by
which
the
males
of
many
insects
find
their
females
,
can
we
admire
the
production
for
this
single
purpose
of
thousands
of
drones
,
which
are
utterly
useless
to
the
community
for
any
other
purpose
,
and
which
are
ultimately
slaughtered
by
their
industrious
and
sterile
sisters
?
It
may
be
difficult
,
but
we
ought
to
admire
the
savage
instinctive
hatred
of
the
queen
bee
,
which
urges
her
to
destroy
the
young
queens
,
her
daughters
,
as
soon
as
they
are
born
,
or
to
perish
herself
in
the
combat
;
for
undoubtedly
this
is
for
the
good
of
the
community
;
and
maternal
love
or
maternal
hatred
,
though
the
latter
fortunately
is
most
rare
,
is
all
the
same
to
the
inexorable
principle
of
natural
selection
.
If
we
admire
the
several
ingenious
contrivances
,
by
which
orchids
and
many
other
plants
are
fertilised
through
insect
agency
,
can
we
consider
as
equally
perfect
the
elaboration
of
dense
clouds
of
pollen
by
our
fir
trees
,
so
that
a
few
granules
may
be
wafted
by
chance
on
to
the
ovules
?
Summary
:
the
Law
of
Unity
of
Type
and
of
the
Conditions
of
Existence
embraced
by
the
Theory
of
Natural
Selection
We
have
in
this
chapter
discussed
some
of
the
difficulties
and
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
the
theory
.
Many
of
them
are
serious
;
but
I
think
that
in
the
discussion
light
has
been
thrown
on
several
facts
,
which
on
the
belief
of
independent
acts
of
creation
are
utterly
obscure
.
We
have
seen
that
species
at
any
one
period
are
not
indefinitely
variable
,
and
are
not
linked
together
by
a
multitude
of
intermediate
gradations
,
partly
because
the
process
of
natural
selection
is
always
very
slow
,
and
at
any
one
time
acts
only
on
a
few
forms
;
and
partly
because
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
implies
the
continual
supplanting
and
extinction
of
preceding
and
intermediate
gradations
.
Closely
allied
species
,
now
living
on
a
continuous
area
,
must
often
have
been
formed
when
the
area
was
not
continuous
,
and
when
the
conditions
of
life
did
not
insensibly
graduate
away
from
one
part
to
another
.
When
two
varieties
are
formed
in
two
districts
of
a
continuous
area
,
an
intermediate
variety
will
often
be
formed
,
fitted
for
an
intermediate
zone
;
but
from
reasons
assigned
,
the
intermediate
variety
will
usually
exist
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
two
forms
which
it
connects
;
consequently
the
two
latter
,
during
the
course
of
further
modification
,
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
,
will
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
less
numerous
intermediate
variety
,
and
will
thus
generally
succeed
in
supplanting
and
exterminating
it
.
We
have
seen
in
this
chapter
how
cautious
we
should
be
in
concluding
that
the
most
different
habits
of
life
could
not
graduate
into
each
other
;
that
a
bat
,
for
instance
,
could
not
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
from
an
animal
which
at
first
only
glided
through
the
air
.
We
have
seen
that
a
species
under
new
conditions
of
life
may
change
its
habits
;
or
it
may
have
diversified
habits
,
with
some
very
unlike
those
of
its
nearest
congeners
.
Hence
we
can
understand
,
bearing
in
mind
that
each
organic
being
is
trying
to
live
wherever
it
can
live
,
how
it
has
arisen
that
there
are
upland
geese
with
webbed
feet
,
ground
woodpeckers
,
diving
thrushes
,
and
petrels
with
the
habits
of
auks
.
Although
the
belief
that
an
organ
so
perfect
as
the
eye
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
,
is
enough
to
stagger
any
one
;
yet
in
the
case
of
any
organ
,
if
we
know
of
a
long
series
of
gradations
in
complexity
,
each
good
for
its
possessor
,
then
,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
,
there
is
no
logical
impossibility
in
the
acquirement
of
any
conceivable
degree
of
perfection
through
natural
selection
.
In
the
cases
in
which
we
know
of
no
intermediate
or
transitional
states
,
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
none
can
have
existed
,
for
the
metamorphoses
of
many
organs
show
what
wonderful
changes
in
function
are
at
least
possible
.
For
instance
,
a
swimbladder
has
apparently
been
converted
into
an
air
breathing
lung
.
The
same
organ
having
performed
simultaneously
very
different
functions
,
and
then
having
been
in
part
or
in
whole
specialised
for
one
function
;
and
two
distinct
organs
having
performed
at
the
same
time
the
same
function
,
the
one
having
been
perfected
whilst
aided
by
the
other
,
must
often
have
largely
facilitated
transitions
.
We
have
seen
that
in
two
beings
widely
remote
from
each
other
in
the
natural
scale
,
organs
serving
for
the
same
purpose
and
in
external
appearance
closely
similar
may
have
been
separately
and
independently
formed
;
but
when
such
organs
are
closely
examined
,
essential
differences
in
their
structure
can
almost
always
be
detected
;
and
this
naturally
follows
from
the
principle
of
natural
selection
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
common
rule
throughout
nature
is
infinite
diversity
of
structure
for
gaining
the
same
end
;
and
this
again
naturally
follows
from
the
same
great
principle
.
In
many
cases
we
are
far
too
ignorant
to
be
enabled
to
assert
that
a
part
or
organ
is
so
unimportant
for
the
welfare
of
a
species
,
that
modifications
in
its
structure
could
not
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
means
of
natural
selection
.
In
many
other
cases
,
modifications
are
probably
the
direct
result
of
the
laws
of
variation
or
of
growth
,
independently
of
any
good
having
been
thus
gained
.
But
even
such
structures
have
often
,
as
we
may
feel
assured
,
been
subsequently
taken
advantage
of
,
and
still
further
modified
,
for
the
good
of
species
under
new
conditions
of
life
.
We
may
,
also
,
believe
that
a
part
formerly
of
high
importance
has
frequently
been
retained
(
as
the
tail
of
an
aquatic
animal
by
its
terrestrial
descendants
)
,
though
it
has
become
of
such
small
importance
that
it
could
not
,
in
its
present
state
,
have
been
acquired
by
means
of
natural
selection
.
Natural
selection
can
produce
nothing
in
one
species
for
the
exclusive
good
or
injury
of
another
;
though
it
may
well
produce
parts
,
organs
,
and
excretions
highly
useful
or
even
indispensable
,
or
again
highly
injurious
to
another
species
,
but
in
all
cases
at
the
same
time
useful
to
the
possessor
.
In
each
well
stocked
country
natural
selection
acts
through
the
competition
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
consequently
leads
to
success
in
the
battle
for
life
,
only
in
accordance
with
the
standard
of
that
particular
country
.
Hence
the
inhabitants
of
one
country
,
generally
the
smaller
one
,
often
yield
to
the
inhabitants
of
another
and
generally
the
larger
country
.
For
in
the
larger
country
there
will
have
existed
more
individuals
and
more
diversified
forms
,
and
the
competition
will
have
been
severer
,
and
thus
the
standard
of
perfection
will
have
been
rendered
higher
.
Natural
selection
will
not
necessarily
lead
to
absolute
perfection
;
nor
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
by
our
limited
faculties
,
can
absolute
perfection
be
everywhere
predicated
.
On
the
theory
of
natural
selection
we
can
clearly
understand
the
full
meaning
of
that
old
canon
in
natural
history
,
"
Natura
non
facit
saltum
.
"
This
canon
,
if
we
look
to
the
present
inhabitants
alone
of
the
world
,
is
not
strictly
correct
;
but
if
we
include
all
those
of
past
times
,
whether
known
or
unknown
,
it
must
on
this
theory
be
strictly
true
.
It
is
generally
acknowledged
that
all
organic
beings
have
been
formed
on
two
great
laws
:
Unity
of
Type
,
and
the
Conditions
of
Existence
.
By
unity
of
type
is
meant
that
fundamental
agreement
in
structure
which
we
see
in
organic
beings
of
the
same
class
,
and
which
is
quite
independent
of
their
habits
of
life
.
On
my
theory
,
unity
of
type
is
explained
by
unity
of
descent
.
The
expression
of
conditions
of
existence
,
so
often
insisted
on
by
the
illustrious
Cuvier
,
is
fully
embraced
by
the
principle
of
natural
selection
.
For
natural
selection
acts
by
either
now
adapting
the
varying
parts
of
each
being
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
;
or
by
having
adapted
them
during
past
periods
of
time
:
the
adaptations
being
aided
in
many
cases
by
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
,
being
affected
by
the
direct
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
,
and
subjected
in
all
cases
to
the
several
laws
of
growth
and
variation
.
Hence
,
in
fact
,
the
law
of
the
Conditions
of
Existence
is
the
higher
law
;
as
it
includes
,
through
the
inheritance
of
former
variations
and
adaptations
,
that
of
Unity
of
Type
.
CHAPTER
VII
MISCELLANEOUS
OBJECTIONS
TO
THE
THEORY
OF
NATURAL
SELECTION
I
WILL
devote
this
chapter
to
the
consideration
of
various
miscellaneous
objections
which
have
been
advanced
against
my
views
,
as
some
of
the
previous
discussions
may
thus
be
made
clearer
;
but
it
would
be
useless
to
discuss
all
of
them
,
as
many
have
been
made
by
writers
who
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
understand
the
subject
.
Thus
a
distinguished
German
naturalist
has
asserted
that
the
weakest
part
of
my
theory
is
,
that
I
consider
all
organic
beings
as
imperfect
:
what
I
have
really
said
is
,
that
all
are
not
as
perfect
as
they
might
have
been
in
relation
to
their
conditions
;
and
this
is
shown
to
be
the
case
by
so
many
native
forms
in
many
quarters
of
the
world
having
yielded
their
places
to
intruding
foreigners
.
Nor
can
organic
beings
,
even
if
they
were
at
any
one
time
perfectly
adapted
to
their
conditions
of
life
,
have
remained
so
,
when
their
conditions
changed
,
unless
they
themselves
likewise
changed
;
and
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
physical
conditions
of
each
country
,
as
well
as
the
numbers
and
kinds
of
its
inhabitants
,
have
undergone
many
mutations
.
A
critic
has
lately
insisted
,
with
some
parade
of
mathematical
accuracy
,
that
longevity
is
a
great
advantage
to
all
species
,
so
that
he
who
believes
in
natural
selection
"
must
arrange
his
genealogical
tree
"
in
such
a
manner
that
all
the
descendants
have
longer
lives
than
their
progenitors!
Cannot
our
critic
conceive
that
a
biennial
plant
or
one
of
the
lower
animals
might
range
into
a
cold
climate
and
perish
there
every
winter
;
and
yet
,
owing
to
advantages
gained
through
natural
selection
,
survive
from
year
to
year
by
means
of
its
seeds
or
ova
?
Mr
.
E
.
Ray
Lankester
has
recently
discussed
this
subject
,
and
he
concludes
,
as
far
as
its
extreme
complexity
allows
him
to
form
a
judgment
,
that
longevity
is
generally
related
to
the
standard
of
each
species
in
the
scale
of
organisation
,
as
well
as
to
the
amount
of
expenditure
in
reproduction
and
in
general
activity
.
And
these
conditions
have
,
it
is
probable
,
been
largely
determined
through
natural
selection
.
It
has
been
argued
that
,
as
none
of
the
animals
and
plants
of
Egypt
,
of
which
we
know
anything
,
have
changed
during
the
last
three
or
four
thousand
years
,
so
probably
have
none
in
any
part
of
the
world
.
But
,
as
Mr
.
G
.
H
.
Lewes
has
remarked
,
this
line
of
argument
proves
too
much
,
for
the
ancient
domestic
races
figured
on
the
Egyptian
monuments
,
or
embalmed
,
are
closely
similar
or
even
identical
with
those
now
living
;
yet
all
naturalists
admit
that
such
races
have
been
produced
through
the
modification
of
their
original
types
.
The
many
animals
which
have
remained
unchanged
since
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
,
would
have
been
an
incomparably
stronger
case
,
for
these
have
been
exposed
to
great
changes
of
climate
and
have
migrated
over
great
distances
;
whereas
,
in
Egypt
,
during
the
last
several
thousand
years
,
the
conditions
of
life
,
as
far
as
we
know
,
have
remained
absolutely
uniform
.
The
fact
of
little
or
no
modification
having
been
effected
since
the
glacial
period
would
have
been
of
some
avail
against
those
who
believe
in
an
innate
and
necessary
law
of
development
,
but
is
powerless
against
the
doctrine
of
natural
selection
or
the
survival
of
the
fittest
,
which
implies
that
when
variations
or
individual
differences
of
a
beneficial
nature
happen
to
arise
,
these
will
be
preserved
;
but
this
will
be
effected
only
under
certain
favourable
circumstances
.
The
celebrated
palaeontologist
,
Bronn
,
at
the
close
of
his
German
translation
of
this
work
,
asks
,
how
,
on
the
principle
of
natural
selection
,
can
a
variety
live
side
by
side
with
the
parent
species
?
If
both
have
become
fitted
for
slightly
different
habits
of
life
or
conditions
,
they
might
live
together
;
and
if
we
lay
on
one
side
polymorphic
species
,
in
which
the
variability
seems
to
be
of
a
peculiar
nature
,
and
all
mere
temporary
variations
,
such
as
size
,
albinism
,
&c
.
,
the
more
permanent
varieties
are
generally
found
,
as
far
as
I
can
discover
,
inhabiting
distinct
stations
,
such
as
high
land
or
low
land
,
dry
or
moist
districts
.
Moreover
,
in
the
case
of
animals
which
wander
much
about
and
cross
freely
,
their
varieties
seem
to
be
generally
confined
to
distinct
regions
.
Bronn
also
insists
that
distinct
species
never
differ
from
each
other
in
single
characters
,
but
in
many
parts
;
and
he
asks
,
how
it
always
comes
that
many
parts
of
the
organisation
should
have
been
modified
at
the
same
time
through
variation
and
natural
selection
.
"
But
there
is
no
necessity
for
supposing
that
all
the
parts
of
any
being
have
been
simultaneously
modified
.
The
most
striking
modifications
,
excellently
adapted
for
some
purpose
,
might
,
as
was
formerly
remarked
,
be
acquired
by
successive
variations
,
if
slight
,
first
in
one
part
and
then
in
another
;
and
as
they
would
be
transmitted
all
together
,
they
would
appear
to
us
as
if
they
had
been
simultaneously
developed
.
The
best
answer
,
however
,
to
the
above
objection
is
afforded
by
those
domestic
races
which
have
been
modified
,
chiefly
through
man's
power
of
selection
,
for
some
special
purpose
.
Look
at
the
race
and
dray
horse
,
or
at
the
greyhound
and
mastiff
.
Their
whole
frames
and
even
their
mental
characteristics
have
been
modified
;
but
if
we
could
trace
each
step
in
the
history
of
their
transformation
,
and
the
latter
steps
can
be
traced
,
we
should
not
see
great
and
simultaneous
changes
,
but
first
one
part
and
then
another
slightly
modified
and
improved
.
Even
when
selection
has
been
applied
by
man
to
some
one
character
alone
,
of
which
our
cultivated
plants
offer
the
best
instances
,
it
will
invariably
be
found
that
although
this
one
part
,
whether
it
be
the
flower
,
fruit
,
or
leaves
,
has
been
greatly
changed
,
almost
all
the
other
parts
have
been
slightly
modified
.
This
may
be
attributed
partly
to
the
principle
of
correlated
growth
,
and
partly
to
so
called
spontaneous
variation
.
A
much
more
serious
objection
has
been
urged
by
Bronn
,
and
recently
by
Broca
,
namely
,
that
many
characters
appear
to
be
of
no
service
whatever
to
their
possessors
,
and
therefore
cannot
have
been
influenced
through
natural
selection
.
Bronn
adduces
the
length
of
the
ears
and
tails
in
the
different
species
of
hares
and
mice
,
the
complex
folds
of
enamel
in
the
teeth
of
many
animals
,
and
a
multitude
of
analogous
cases
.
With
respect
to
plants
,
this
subject
has
been
discussed
by
Nageli
in
an
admirable
essay
.
He
admits
that
natural
selection
has
effected
much
,
but
he
insists
that
the
families
of
plants
differ
chiefly
from
each
other
in
morphological
characters
,
which
appear
to
be
quite
unimportant
for
the
welfare
of
the
species
.
He
consequently
believes
in
an
innate
tendency
towards
progressive
and
more
perfect
development
.
He
specifies
the
arrangement
of
the
cells
in
the
tissues
,
and
of
the
leaves
on
the
axis
,
as
cases
in
which
natural
selection
could
not
have
acted
.
To
these
may
be
added
the
numerical
divisions
in
the
parts
of
the
flower
,
the
position
of
the
ovules
,
the
shape
of
the
seed
,
when
not
of
any
use
for
dissemination
,
&c
.
There
is
much
force
in
the
above
objection
.
Nevertheless
,
we
ought
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
pretending
to
decide
what
structures
now
are
,
or
have
formerly
been
,
use
to
each
species
.
In
the
second
place
,
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
that
when
part
is
modified
,
so
will
be
other
parts
,
through
certain
dimly
seen
causes
,
such
as
an
increased
or
diminished
flow
of
nutriment
to
a
part
,
mutual
pressure
,
an
early
developed
part
affecting
one
subsequently
developed
,
and
so
forth
,
as
well
as
through
other
causes
which
lead
to
the
many
mysterious
cases
of
correlation
,
which
we
do
not
in
the
least
understand
.
These
agencies
may
be
all
grouped
together
,
for
the
sake
of
brevity
,
under
the
expression
of
the
laws
of
growth
.
In
the
third
place
,
we
have
to
allow
for
the
direct
and
definite
action
of
changed
conditions
of
life
,
and
for
so
called
spontaneous
variations
,
in
which
the
nature
of
the
conditions
apparently
plays
a
quite
subordinate
part
.
Bud
variations
,
such
as
the
appearance
of
a
moss
rose
on
a
common
rose
,
or
of
a
nectarine
on
a
peach
tree
offer
good
instances
of
spontaneous
variations
;
but
even
in
these
cases
,
if
we
bear
in
mind
the
power
of
a
minute
drop
of
poison
in
producing
complex
galls
,
we
ought
not
to
feel
too
sure
that
the
above
variations
are
not
the
effect
of
some
local
change
in
the
nature
of
the
sap
,
due
to
some
change
in
the
conditions
.
There
must
be
some
efficient
cause
for
each
slight
individual
difference
,
as
well
as
for
more
strongly
marked
variations
which
occasionally
arise
;
and
if
the
unknown
cause
were
to
act
persistently
,
it
is
almost
certain
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
species
would
be
similarly
modified
.
In
the
earlier
editions
of
this
work
I
underrated
,
as
it
now
seems
probable
,
the
frequency
and
importance
of
modifications
due
to
spontaneous
variability
.
But
it
is
impossible
to
attribute
to
this
cause
the
innumerable
structures
which
are
so
well
adapted
to
the
habits
of
life
of
each
species
.
I
can
no
more
believe
in
this
than
that
the
well
adapted
form
of
a
race
horse
or
greyhound
,
which
before
the
principle
of
selection
by
man
was
well
understood
,
excited
so
much
surprise
in
the
minds
of
the
older
naturalists
,
can
thus
be
explained
.
It
may
be
worth
while
to
illustrate
some
of
the
foregoing
remarks
.
With
respect
to
the
assumed
inutility
of
various
parts
and
organs
,
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
that
even
in
the
higher
and
best
known
animals
many
structures
exist
,
which
are
so
highly
developed
that
no
one
doubts
that
they
are
of
importance
,
yet
their
use
has
not
been
,
or
has
only
recently
been
,
ascertained
.
As
Bronn
gives
the
length
of
the
ears
and
tail
in
the
several
species
of
mice
as
instances
,
though
trifling
ones
,
of
differences
in
structure
which
can
be
of
no
special
use
,
I
may
mention
that
,
according
to
Dr
.
Schobl
,
the
external
ears
of
the
common
mouse
are
supplied
in
an
extraordinary
manner
with
nerves
,
so
that
they
no
doubt
serve
as
tactile
organs
;
hence
the
length
of
the
ears
can
hardly
be
quite
unimportant
.
We
shall
,
also
,
presently
see
that
the
tail
is
a
highly
useful
prehensile
organ
to
some
of
the
species
;
and
its
use
would
be
much
influenced
by
its
length
.
With
respect
to
plants
,
to
which
on
account
of
Nageli's
essay
I
shall
confine
myself
in
the
following
remarks
,
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
flowers
of
orchids
present
a
multitude
of
curious
structures
,
which
a
few
years
ago
would
have
been
considered
as
mere
morphological
differences
without
any
special
function
;
but
they
are
now
known
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
for
the
fertilisation
of
the
species
through
the
aid
of
insects
,
and
have
probably
been
gained
through
natural
selection
.
No
one
until
lately
would
have
imagined
that
in
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
the
different
lengths
of
the
stamens
and
pistils
,
and
their
arrangement
,
could
have
been
of
any
service
,
but
now
we
know
this
to
be
the
case
.
In
certain
whole
groups
of
plants
the
ovules
stand
erect
,
and
in
others
they
are
suspended
;
and
within
the
same
ovarium
of
some
few
plants
,
one
ovule
holds
the
former
and
a
second
ovule
the
latter
position
.
These
positions
seem
at
first
purely
morphological
,
or
of
no
physiological
signification
;
but
Dr
.
Hooker
informs
me
that
within
the
same
ovarium
,
the
upper
ovules
alone
in
some
cases
,
and
in
other
cases
the
lower
ones
alone
are
fertilised
;
and
he
suggests
that
this
probably
depends
on
the
direction
in
which
the
pollen
tubes
enter
the
ovarium
.
If
so
,
the
position
of
the
ovules
,
even
when
one
is
erect
and
the
other
suspended
within
the
same
ovarium
,
would
follow
from
the
selection
of
any
slight
deviations
in
position
which
favoured
their
fertilisation
,
and
the
production
of
seed
.
Several
plants
belonging
to
distinct
orders
habitually
produce
flowers
of
two
kinds
,
the
one
open
of
the
ordinary
structure
,
the
other
closed
and
imperfect
.
These
two
kinds
of
flowers
sometimes
differ
wonderfully
in
structure
,
yet
may
be
seen
to
graduate
into
each
other
on
the
same
plant
.
The
ordinary
and
open
flowers
can
be
intercrossed
;
and
the
benefits
which
certainly
are
derived
from
this
process
are
thus
secured
.
The
closed
and
imperfect
flowers
are
,
however
,
manifestly
of
high
importance
,
as
they
yield
with
the
utmost
safety
a
large
stock
of
seed
,
with
the
expenditure
of
wonderfully
little
pollen
.
The
two
kinds
of
flowers
often
differ
much
,
as
just
stated
,
in
structure
.
The
petals
in
the
imperfect
flowers
almost
always
consist
of
mere
rudiments
,
and
the
pollen
grains
are
reduced
in
diameter
.
In
Ononis
columnae
five
of
the
alternate
stamens
are
rudimentary
;
and
in
some
species
of
Viola
three
stamens
are
in
this
state
,
two
retaining
their
proper
function
,
but
being
of
very
small
size
.
In
six
out
of
thirty
of
the
closed
flowers
in
an
Indian
violet
(
name
unknown
,
for
the
plants
have
never
produced
with
me
perfect
flowers
)
,
the
sepals
are
reduced
from
the
normal
number
of
five
to
three
.
In
one
section
of
the
Malpighiaceae
the
closed
flowers
,
according
to
A
.
de
Jussieu
,
are
still
further
modified
,
for
the
five
stamens
which
stand
opposite
to
the
sepals
are
all
aborted
,
sixth
stamen
standing
opposite
to
a
petal
being
alone
developed
;
and
this
stamen
is
not
present
in
the
ordinary
flowers
of
these
species
;
the
style
is
aborted
;
and
the
ovaria
are
reduced
from
three
to
two
.
Now
although
natural
selection
may
well
have
had
the
power
to
prevent
some
of
the
flowers
from
expanding
,
and
to
reduce
the
amount
of
pollen
,
when
rendered
by
the
closure
of
the
flowers
superfluous
,
yet
hardly
any
of
the
above
special
modifications
can
have
been
thus
determined
,
but
must
have
followed
from
the
laws
of
growth
,
including
the
functional
inactivity
of
parts
,
during
the
progress
of
the
reduction
of
the
pollen
and
the
closure
of
the
flowers
.
It
is
so
necessary
to
appreciate
the
important
effects
of
the
laws
of
growth
,
that
I
will
give
some
additional
cases
of
another
kind
,
namely
of
differences
in
the
same
part
or
organ
,
due
to
differences
in
relative
position
on
the
same
plant
.
In
the
Spanish
chestnut
,
and
in
certain
fir
trees
,
the
angles
of
divergence
of
the
leaves
differ
,
according
to
Schacht
,
in
the
nearly
horizontal
and
in
the
upright
branches
.
In
the
common
rue
and
some
other
plants
,
one
flower
,
usually
the
central
or
terminal
one
,
opens
first
,
and
has
five
sepals
and
petals
,
and
five
divisions
to
the
ovarium
;
whilst
all
the
other
flowers
on
the
plant
are
tetramerous
.
In
the
British
Adoxa
the
uppermost
flower
generally
has
two
calyx
lobes
with
the
other
organs
tetramerous
,
whilst
the
surrounding
flowers
generally
have
three
calyx
lobes
with
the
other
organs
pentamerous
.
In
many
Compositae
and
Umbelliferae
(
and
in
some
other
plants
)
the
circumferential
flowers
have
their
corollas
much
more
developed
than
those
of
the
centre
;
and
this
seems
often
connected
with
the
abortion
of
the
reproductive
organs
.
It
is
a
more
curious
fact
,
previously
referred
to
,
that
the
achenes
or
seeds
of
the
circumference
and
centre
sometimes
differ
greatly
in
form
,
colour
,
and
other
characters
.
In
Carthamus
and
some
other
Compositae
the
central
achenes
alone
are
furnished
with
a
pappus
;
and
in
Hyoseris
the
same
head
yields
achenes
of
three
different
forms
.
In
certain
Umbelliferae
the
exterior
seeds
,
according
to
Tausch
,
are
orthospermous
,
and
the
central
one
coelospermous
,
and
this
is
a
character
which
was
considered
by
De
Candolle
to
be
in
other
species
of
the
highest
systematic
importance
.
Prof
.
Braun
mentions
a
Fumariaceous
genus
,
in
which
the
flowers
in
the
lower
part
of
the
spike
bear
oval
,
ribbed
,
one
seeded
nutlets
;
and
in
the
upper
part
of
the
spike
,
lanceolate
,
two
valved
,
and
two
seeded
siliques
.
In
these
several
cases
,
with
the
exception
of
that
of
the
well
developed
rayflorets
,
which
are
of
service
in
making
the
flowers
conspicuous
to
insects
,
natural
selection
cannot
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
have
come
into
play
,
or
only
in
a
quite
subordinate
manner
.
All
these
modifications
follow
from
the
relative
position
and
inter
action
of
the
parts
;
and
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
if
all
the
flowers
and
leaves
on
the
same
plant
had
been
subjected
to
the
same
external
and
internal
condition
,
as
are
the
flowers
and
leaves
in
certain
positions
,
all
would
have
been
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
In
numerous
other
cases
we
find
modifications
of
structure
,
which
are
considered
by
botanists
to
be
generally
of
a
highly
important
nature
,
affecting
only
some
of
the
flowers
on
the
same
plant
,
or
occurring
on
distinct
plants
,
which
grow
close
together
under
the
same
conditions
.
As
these
variations
seem
of
no
special
use
to
the
plants
,
they
cannot
have
been
influenced
by
natural
selection
.
Of
their
cause
we
are
quite
ignorant
;
we
cannot
even
attribute
them
,
as
in
the
last
class
of
cases
,
to
any
proximate
agency
,
such
as
relative
position
.
I
will
give
only
a
few
instances
.
It
is
so
common
to
observe
on
the
same
plant
,
flowers
indifferently
tetramerous
,
pentamerous
,
&c
.
,
that
I
need
not
give
examples
;
but
as
numerical
variations
are
comparatively
rare
when
the
parts
are
few
,
I
may
mention
that
,
according
to
De
Candolle
,
the
flowers
of
Papaver
bracteatum
offer
either
two
sepals
with
four
petals
(
which
is
the
common
type
with
poppies
)
,
or
three
sepals
with
six
petals
.
The
manner
in
which
the
petals
are
folded
in
the
bud
is
in
most
groups
a
very
constant
morphological
character
;
but
Professor
Asa
Gray
states
that
with
some
species
of
Mimulus
,
the
aestivation
is
almost
as
frequently
that
of
the
Rhinanthideae
as
of
the
Antirrhinideae
,
to
which
latter
tribe
the
genus
belongs
.
Auguste
de
Saint
Hilaire
gives
the
following
cases
:
the
genus
Zanthoxylon
belongs
to
a
division
of
the
Rutacese
with
a
single
ovary
,
but
in
some
species
flowers
may
be
found
on
the
same
plant
,
and
even
in
the
same
panicle
,
with
either
one
or
two
ovaries
.
In
Helianthemum
the
capsule
has
been
described
as
unilocular
or
trilocular
;
and
in
H
.
mutabile
,
"
Une
lame
,
plus
ou
moins
large
,
s'etend
entre
le
pericarpe
et
le
placenta
.
"
In
the
flowers
of
Saponaria
officinalis
,
Dr
.
Masters
has
observed
instances
of
both
marginal
and
free
central
placentation
.
Lastly
,
Saint
Hilaire
found
towards
the
southern
extreme
of
the
range
of
Gomphia
oleaeformis
two
forms
which
he
did
not
at
first
doubt
were
distinct
species
,
but
he
subsequently
saw
them
growing
on
the
same
bush
;
and
he
then
adds
,
"
Voila
donc
dans
un
meme
individu
des
loges
et
un
style
qui
se
rattachent
tantot
a
un
axe
verticale
et
tantot
a
un
gynobase
.
"
We
thus
see
that
with
plants
many
morphological
changes
may
be
attributed
to
the
laws
of
growth
and
the
inter
action
of
parts
,
independently
of
natural
selection
.
But
with
respect
to
Nageli's
doctrine
of
an
innate
tendency
towards
perfection
or
progressive
development
,
can
it
be
said
in
the
case
of
these
strongly
pronounced
variations
,
that
the
plants
have
been
caught
in
the
act
of
progressing
towards
a
higher
state
of
development
?
On
the
contrary
,
I
should
infer
from
the
mere
fact
of
the
parts
in
question
differing
or
varying
greatly
on
the
same
plant
,
that
such
modifications
were
of
extremely
small
importance
to
the
plants
themselves
,
of
whatever
importance
they
may
generally
be
to
us
for
our
classifications
.
The
acquisition
of
a
useless
part
can
hardly
be
said
to
raise
an
organism
in
the
natural
scale
;
and
in
the
case
of
the
imperfect
,
closed
flowers
above
described
,
if
any
new
principle
has
to
be
invoked
,
it
must
be
one
of
retrogression
rather
than
of
progression
;
and
so
it
must
be
with
many
parasitic
and
degraded
animals
.
We
are
ignorant
of
the
exciting
cause
of
the
above
specified
modifications
;
but
if
the
unknown
cause
were
to
act
almost
uniformly
for
a
length
of
time
,
we
may
infer
that
the
result
would
be
almost
uniform
;
and
in
this
case
all
the
individuals
of
the
species
would
be
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
From
the
fact
of
the
above
characters
being
unimportant
for
the
welfare
of
the
species
,
any
slight
variations
which
occurred
in
them
would
not
have
been
accumulated
and
augmented
through
natural
selection
.
A
structure
which
has
been
developed
through
long
continued
selection
,
when
it
ceases
to
be
of
service
to
a
species
,
generally
becomes
variable
,
as
we
see
with
rudimentary
organs
;
for
it
will
no
longer
be
regulated
by
this
same
power
of
selection
.
But
when
,
from
the
nature
of
the
organism
and
of
the
conditions
,
modifications
have
been
induced
which
are
unimportant
for
the
welfare
of
the
species
,
they
may
be
,
and
apparently
often
have
been
,
transmitted
in
nearly
the
same
state
to
numerous
,
otherwise
modified
,
descendants
.
It
cannot
have
been
of
much
importance
to
the
greater
number
of
mammals
,
birds
,
or
reptiles
,
whether
they
were
clothed
with
hair
,
feathers
,
or
scales
;
yet
hair
has
been
transmitted
to
almost
all
mammals
,
feathers
to
all
birds
,
and
scales
to
all
true
reptiles
.
A
structure
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
which
is
common
to
many
allied
forms
,
is
ranked
by
us
as
of
high
systematic
importance
,
and
consequently
is
often
assumed
to
be
of
high
vital
importance
to
the
species
.
Thus
,
as
I
am
inclined
to
believe
,
differences
,
which
we
consider
as
important
such
as
the
arrangement
of
the
leaves
,
the
divisions
of
the
flower
or
of
the
ovarium
,
the
position
of
the
ovules
,
&c
.
first
appeared
in
many
cases
as
fluctuating
variations
,
which
sooner
or
later
became
constant
through
the
nature
of
the
organism
and
of
the
surrounding
conditions
,
as
well
as
through
the
intercrossing
of
distinct
individuals
,
but
not
through
natural
selection
;
for
as
these
morphological
characters
do
not
affect
the
welfare
of
the
species
,
any
slight
deviations
in
them
could
not
have
been
governed
or
accumulated
through
this
latter
agency
.
It
is
a
strange
result
which
we
thus
arrive
at
,
namely
that
characters
of
slight
vital
importance
to
the
species
,
are
the
most
important
to
the
systematist
;
but
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
when
we
treat
of
the
genetic
principle
of
classification
,
this
is
by
no
means
so
paradoxical
as
it
may
at
first
appear
.
Although
we
have
no
good
evidence
of
the
existence
in
organic
beings
of
an
innate
tendency
towards
progressive
development
,
yet
this
necessarily
follows
,
as
I
have
attempted
to
show
in
the
fourth
chapter
,
through
the
continued
action
of
natural
selection
.
For
the
best
definition
which
has
ever
been
given
of
a
high
standard
of
organisation
,
is
the
degree
to
which
the
parts
have
been
specialised
or
differentiated
;
and
natural
selection
tends
towards
this
end
,
inasmuch
as
the
parts
are
thus
enabled
to
perform
their
functions
more
efficiently
.
A
distinguished
zoologist
,
Mr
.
St
.
George
Mivart
,
has
recently
collected
all
the
objections
which
have
ever
been
advanced
by
myself
and
others
against
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
as
propounded
by
Mr
.
Wallace
and
myself
,
and
has
illustrated
them
with
admirable
art
and
force
.
When
thus
marshalled
,
they
make
a
formidable
array
;
and
as
it
forms
no
part
of
Mr
.
Mivart's
plan
to
give
the
various
facts
and
considerations
opposed
to
his
conclusions
,
no
slight
effort
of
reason
and
memory
is
left
to
the
reader
,
who
may
wish
to
weigh
the
evidence
on
both
sides
.
When
discussing
special
cases
,
Mr
.
Mivart
passes
over
the
effects
of
the
increased
use
and
disuse
of
parts
,
which
I
have
always
maintained
to
be
highly
important
,
and
have
treated
in
my
Variation
under
Domestication
at
greater
length
than
,
as
I
believe
,
any
other
writer
.
He
likewise
often
assumes
that
I
attribute
nothing
to
variation
,
independently
of
natural
selection
,
whereas
in
the
work
just
referred
to
I
have
collected
a
greater
number
of
well
established
cases
than
can
be
found
in
any
other
work
known
to
me
.
My
judgment
may
not
be
trustworthy
,
but
after
reading
with
care
Mr
.
Mivart's
book
,
and
comparing
each
section
with
what
I
have
said
on
the
same
head
,
I
never
before
felt
so
strongly
convinced
of
the
general
truth
of
the
conclusions
here
arrived
at
,
subject
,
of
course
,
in
so
intricate
a
subject
,
to
much
partial
error
.
All
Mr
.
Mivart's
objections
will
be
,
or
have
been
,
considered
in
the
present
volume
.
The
one
new
point
which
appears
to
have
struck
many
readers
is
,
"
that
natural
selection
is
incompetent
to
account
for
the
incipient
stages
of
useful
structures
.
"
This
subject
is
intimately
connected
with
that
of
the
gradation
of
characters
,
often
accompanied
by
a
change
of
function
,
for
instance
,
the
conversion
of
a
swimbladder
into
lungs
,
points
which
were
discussed
in
the
last
chapter
under
two
headings
.
Nevertheless
,
I
will
here
consider
in
some
detail
several
of
the
cases
advanced
by
Mr
.
Mivart
,
selecting
those
which
are
the
most
illustrative
,
as
want
of
space
prevents
me
from
considering
all
.
The
giraffe
,
by
its
lofty
stature
,
much
elongated
neck
,
fore
legs
,
head
and
tongue
,
has
its
whole
frame
beautifully
adapted
for
browsing
on
the
higher
branches
of
trees
.
It
can
thus
obtain
food
beyond
the
reach
of
the
other
Ungulata
or
hoofed
animals
inhabiting
the
same
country
;
and
this
must
be
a
great
advantage
to
it
during
dearths
.
The
Niata
cattle
in
S
.
America
show
us
how
small
a
difference
in
structure
may
make
,
during
such
periods
,
a
great
difference
in
preserving
an
animal's
life
.
These
cattle
can
browse
as
well
as
others
on
grass
,
but
from
the
projection
of
the
lower
jaw
they
cannot
,
during
the
often
recurrent
droughts
,
browse
on
the
twigs
of
trees
,
reeds
,
&c
.
,
to
which
food
the
common
cattle
and
horses
are
then
driven
;
so
that
at
these
times
the
Niatas
perish
,
if
not
fed
by
their
owners
.
Before
coming
to
Mr
.
Mivart's
objections
,
it
may
be
well
to
explain
once
again
how
natural
selection
will
act
in
all
ordinary
cases
.
Man
has
modified
some
of
his
animals
,
without
necessarily
having
attended
to
special
points
of
structure
,
by
simply
preserving
and
breeding
from
the
fleetest
individuals
,
as
with
the
race
horse
and
greyhound
,
or
as
with
the
game
cock
,
by
breeding
from
the
victorious
birds
.
So
under
nature
with
the
nascent
giraffe
the
individuals
which
were
the
highest
browsers
,
and
were
able
during
dearths
to
reach
even
an
inch
or
two
above
the
others
,
will
often
have
been
preserved
;
for
they
will
have
roamed
over
the
whole
country
in
search
of
food
.
That
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
often
differ
slightly
in
the
relative
lengths
of
all
their
parts
may
be
seen
in
many
works
of
natural
history
,
in
which
careful
measurements
are
given
.
These
slight
proportional
differences
,
due
to
the
laws
of
growth
and
variation
,
are
not
of
the
slightest
use
or
importance
to
most
species
.
But
it
will
have
been
otherwise
with
the
nascent
giraffe
,
considering
its
probable
habits
of
life
;
for
those
individuals
which
had
some
one
part
or
several
parts
of
their
bodies
rather
more
elongated
than
usual
,
would
generally
have
survived
.
These
will
have
intercrossed
and
left
offspring
,
either
inheriting
the
same
bodily
peculiarities
,
or
with
a
tendency
to
vary
again
in
the
same
manner
;
whilst
the
individuals
,
less
favoured
in
the
same
respects
,
will
have
been
the
most
liable
to
perish
.
We
here
see
that
there
is
no
need
to
separate
single
pairs
,
as
man
does
,
when
he
methodically
improves
a
breed
:
natural
selection
will
preserve
and
thus
separate
all
the
superior
individuals
,
allowing
them
freely
to
intercross
,
and
will
destroy
all
the
inferior
individuals
.
By
this
process
long
continued
,
which
exactly
corresponds
with
what
I
have
called
unconscious
selection
by
man
,
combined
no
doubt
in
a
most
important
manner
with
the
inherited
effects
of
the
increased
use
of
parts
,
it
seems
to
me
almost
certain
that
an
ordinary
hoofed
quadruped
might
be
converted
into
a
giraffe
.
To
this
conclusion
Mr
.
Mivart
brings
forward
two
objections
.
One
is
that
the
increased
size
of
the
body
would
obviously
require
an
increased
supply
of
food
,
and
he
considers
it
as
"
very
problematical
whether
the
disadvantages
thence
arising
would
not
,
in
times
of
scarcity
,
more
than
counterbalance
the
advantages
.
"
But
as
the
giraffe
does
actually
exist
in
large
numbers
in
S
.
Africa
,
and
as
some
of
the
largest
antelopes
in
the
world
,
taller
than
an
ox
,
abound
there
,
why
should
we
doubt
that
,
as
far
as
size
is
concerned
,
intermediate
gradations
could
formerly
have
existed
there
,
subjected
as
now
to
severe
dearths
.
Assuredly
the
being
able
to
reach
,
at
each
stage
of
increased
size
,
to
a
supply
of
food
,
left
untouched
by
the
other
hoofed
quadrupeds
of
the
country
,
would
have
been
of
some
advantage
to
the
nascent
giraffe
.
Nor
must
we
overlook
the
fact
,
that
increased
bulk
would
act
as
a
protection
against
almost
all
beasts
of
prey
excepting
the
lion
;
and
against
this
animal
,
its
tall
neck
,
and
the
taller
the
better
,
would
,
as
Mr
.
Chauncey
Wright
has
remarked
,
serve
as
a
watch
tower
.
It
is
from
this
cause
,
as
Sir
S
.
Baker
remarks
,
that
no
animal
is
more
difficult
to
stalk
than
the
giraffe
.
This
animal
also
uses
its
long
neck
as
a
means
of
offence
or
defence
,
by
violently
swinging
his
head
armed
with
stump
like
horns
.
The
preservation
of
each
species
can
rarely
be
determined
by
any
one
advantage
,
but
by
the
union
of
all
,
great
and
small
.
Mr
.
Mivart
then
asks
(
and
this
is
his
second
objection
)
,
if
natural
selection
be
so
potent
,
and
if
high
browsing
be
so
great
an
advantage
,
why
has
not
any
other
hoofed
quadruped
acquired
a
long
neck
and
lofty
stature
,
besides
the
giraffe
,
and
,
in
a
lesser
degree
,
the
camel
,
guanaeo
,
and
macrauchenia
?
Or
,
again
,
why
has
not
any
member
of
the
group
acquired
a
long
proboscis
?
With
respect
to
S
.
Africa
,
which
was
formerly
inhabited
by
numerous
herds
of
the
giraffe
,
the
answer
is
not
difficult
,
and
can
best
be
given
by
an
illustration
.
In
every
meadow
in
England
in
which
trees
grow
,
we
see
the
lower
branches
trimmed
or
planed
to
an
exact
level
by
the
browsing
of
the
horses
or
cattle
;
and
what
advantage
would
it
be
,
for
instance
,
to
sheep
,
if
kept
there
,
to
acquire
slightly
longer
necks
?
In
every
district
some
one
kind
of
animal
will
almost
certainly
be
able
to
browse
higher
than
the
others
;
and
it
is
almost
equally
certain
that
this
one
kind
alone
could
have
its
neck
elongated
for
this
purpose
,
through
natural
selection
and
the
effects
of
increased
use
.
In
S
.
Africa
the
competition
for
browsing
on
the
higher
branches
of
the
acacias
and
other
trees
must
be
between
giraffe
and
giraffe
,
and
not
with
the
other
ungulate
animals
.
Why
,
in
other
quarters
of
the
world
,
various
animals
belonging
to
this
same
order
have
not
acquired
either
an
elongated
neck
or
a
proboscis
,
cannot
be
distinctly
answered
;
but
it
is
as
unreasonable
to
expect
a
distinct
answer
to
such
a
question
,
as
why
some
event
in
the
history
of
mankind
did
not
occur
in
one
country
,
whilst
it
did
in
another
.
We
are
ignorant
with
respect
to
the
conditions
which
determine
the
numbers
and
range
of
each
species
;
and
we
cannot
even
conjecture
what
changes
of
structure
would
be
favourable
to
its
increase
in
some
new
country
.
We
can
,
however
,
see
in
a
general
manner
that
various
causes
might
have
interfered
with
the
development
of
a
long
neck
or
proboscis
.
To
reach
the
foliage
at
a
considerable
height
(
without
climbing
,
for
which
hoofed
animals
are
singularly
ill
constructed
)
implies
greatly
increased
bulk
of
body
;
and
we
know
that
some
areas
support
singularly
few
large
quadrupeds
,
for
instance
S
.
America
,
though
it
is
so
luxuriant
;
whilst
S
.
Africa
abounds
with
them
to
an
unparalleled
degree
.
Why
this
should
be
so
,
we
do
not
know
;
nor
why
the
later
tertiary
periods
should
have
been
so
much
more
favourable
for
their
existence
than
the
present
time
.
Whatever
the
causes
may
have
been
,
we
can
see
that
certain
districts
and
times
would
have
been
much
more
favourable
than
others
for
the
development
of
so
large
a
quadruped
as
the
giraffe
.
In
order
that
an
animal
should
acquire
some
structure
specially
and
largely
developed
,
it
is
almost
indispensable
that
several
other
parts
should
be
modified
and
co
adapted
.
Although
every
part
of
the
body
varies
slightly
,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
necessary
parts
should
always
vary
in
the
right
direction
and
to
the
right
degree
.
With
the
different
species
of
our
domesticated
animals
we
know
that
the
parts
vary
in
a
different
manner
and
degree
;
and
that
some
species
are
much
more
variable
than
others
.
Even
if
the
fitting
variations
did
arise
,
it
does
not
follow
that
natural
selection
would
be
able
to
act
on
them
,
and
produce
a
structure
which
apparently
would
be
beneficial
to
the
species
.
For
instance
,
if
the
number
of
individuals
existing
in
a
country
is
determined
chiefly
through
destruction
by
beasts
of
prey
,
by
external
or
internal
parasites
,
&c
.
,
as
seems
often
to
be
the
case
,
then
natural
selection
will
be
able
to
do
little
,
or
will
be
greatly
retarded
,
in
modifying
any
particular
structure
for
obtaining
food
.
Lastly
,
natural
selection
is
a
slow
process
,
and
the
same
favourable
conditions
must
long
endure
in
order
that
any
marked
effect
should
thus
be
produced
.
Except
by
assigning
such
general
and
vague
reasons
,
we
cannot
explain
why
,
in
many
quarters
of
the
world
,
hoofed
quadrupeds
have
not
acquired
much
elongated
necks
or
other
means
for
browsing
on
the
higher
branches
of
trees
.
Objections
of
the
same
nature
as
the
foregoing
have
been
advanced
by
man
writers
.
In
each
case
various
causes
,
besides
the
general
ones
just
indicated
,
have
probably
interfered
with
the
acquisition
through
natural
selection
of
structures
,
which
it
is
thought
would
be
beneficial
to
certain
species
.
One
writer
asks
,
why
has
not
the
ostrich
acquired
the
power
of
flight
?
But
a
moment's
reflection
will
show
what
an
enormous
supply
of
food
would
be
necessary
to
give
to
this
bird
of
the
desert
force
to
move
its
huge
body
through
the
air
.
Oceanic
islands
are
inhabited
by
bats
and
seals
,
but
by
no
terrestrial
mammals
;
yet
as
some
of
these
bats
are
peculiar
species
,
they
must
have
long
inhabited
their
present
homes
.
Therefore
Sir
C
.
Lyell
asks
,
and
assigns
certain
reasons
in
answer
,
why
have
not
seals
and
bats
given
birth
on
such
islands
to
forms
fitted
to
live
on
the
land
?
But
seals
would
necessarily
be
first
converted
into
terrestrial
carnivorous
animals
of
considerable
size
,
and
bats
into
terrestrial
insectivorous
animals
;
for
the
former
there
would
be
no
prey
;
for
the
bats
ground
insects
would
serve
as
food
,
but
these
would
already
be
largely
preyed
on
by
the
reptiles
or
birds
,
which
first
colonise
and
abound
on
most
oceanic
islands
.
Gradations
of
structure
,
with
each
stage
beneficial
to
a
changing
species
,
will
be
favoured
only
under
certain
peculiar
conditions
.
A
strictly
terrestrial
animal
,
by
occasionally
hunting
for
food
in
shallow
water
,
then
in
streams
or
lakes
,
might
at
last
be
converted
into
an
animal
so
thoroughly
aquatic
as
to
brave
the
open
ocean
.
But
seals
would
not
find
on
oceanic
islands
the
conditions
favourable
to
their
gradual
reconversion
into
a
terrestrial
form
.
Bats
,
as
formerly
shown
,
probably
acquired
their
wings
by
at
first
gliding
through
the
air
from
tree
to
tree
,
like
the
so
called
flying
squirrels
,
for
the
sake
of
escaping
from
their
enemies
,
or
for
avoiding
falls
;
but
when
the
power
of
true
flight
had
once
been
acquired
,
it
would
never
be
reconverted
back
,
at
least
for
the
above
purposes
,
into
the
less
efficient
power
of
gliding
through
the
air
.
Bats
might
,
indeed
,
like
many
birds
,
have
had
their
wings
greatly
reduced
in
size
,
or
completely
lost
,
through
disuse
;
but
in
this
case
it
would
be
necessary
that
they
should
first
have
acquired
the
power
of
running
quickly
on
the
ground
,
by
the
aid
of
their
hind
legs
alone
,
so
as
to
compete
with
birds
or
other
ground
animals
;
and
for
such
a
change
a
bat
seems
singularly
ill
fitted
.
These
conjectural
remarks
have
been
made
merely
to
show
that
a
transition
of
structure
,
with
each
step
beneficial
,
is
a
highly
complex
affair
;
and
that
there
is
nothing
strange
in
a
transition
not
having
occurred
in
any
particular
case
.
Lastly
,
more
than
one
writer
has
asked
,
why
have
some
animals
had
their
mental
powers
more
highly
developed
than
others
,
as
such
development
would
be
advantageous
to
an
?
Why
have
not
apes
acquired
the
intellectual
powers
of
man
?
Various
causes
could
be
assigned
;
but
as
they
are
conjectural
,
and
their
relative
probability
cannot
be
weighed
,
it
would
be
useless
to
give
them
.
A
definite
answer
to
the
latter
question
ought
not
to
be
expected
,
seeing
that
no
one
can
solve
the
simpler
problem
why
,
of
two
races
of
savages
,
one
has
risen
higher
in
the
scale
of
civilisation
than
the
other
;
and
this
apparently
implies
increased
brain
power
.
We
will
return
to
Mr
.
Mivart's
other
objections
.
Insects
often
resemble
for
the
sake
of
protection
various
objects
,
such
as
green
or
decayed
leaves
,
dead
twigs
,
bits
of
lichen
,
flowers
,
spines
,
excrement
of
birds
,
and
living
insects
;
but
to
this
latter
point
I
shall
hereafter
recur
.
The
resemblance
is
often
wonderfully
close
,
and
is
not
confined
to
colour
,
but
extends
to
form
,
and
even
to
the
manner
in
which
the
insects
hold
themselves
.
The
caterpillars
which
project
motionless
like
dead
twigs
from
the
bushes
on
which
they
feed
,
offer
an
excellent
instance
of
a
resemblance
of
this
kind
.
The
cases
of
the
imitation
of
such
objects
as
the
excrement
of
birds
,
are
rare
and
exceptional
.
On
this
head
,
Mr
.
Mivart
remarks
,
"
As
,
according
to
Mr
.
Darwin's
theory
,
there
is
a
constant
tendency
to
indefinite
variation
,
and
as
the
minute
incipient
variations
will
be
in
all
directions
,
they
must
tend
to
neutralise
each
other
,
and
at
first
to
form
such
unstable
modifications
that
it
is
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
see
how
such
indefinite
oscillations
of
infinitesimal
beginnings
can
ever
build
up
a
sufficiently
appreciable
resemblance
to
a
leaf
,
bamboo
,
or
other
object
,
for
Natural
Selection
to
seize
upon
and
perpetuate
.
"
But
in
all
the
foregoing
cases
the
insects
in
their
original
state
no
doubt
presented
some
rude
and
accidental
resemblance
to
an
object
commonly
found
in
the
stations
frequented
by
them
.
Nor
is
this
at
all
improbable
,
considering
the
almost
infinite
number
of
surrounding
objects
and
the
diversity
in
form
and
colour
of
the
hosts
of
insects
which
exist
.
As
some
rude
resemblance
is
necessary
for
the
first
start
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
the
larger
and
higher
animals
do
not
(
with
the
exception
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
of
one
fish
)
resemble
for
the
sake
of
protection
special
objects
,
but
only
the
surface
which
commonly
surrounds
them
,
and
this
chiefly
in
colour
.
Assuming
that
an
insect
originally
happened
to
resemble
in
some
degree
a
dead
twig
or
a
decayed
leaf
,
and
that
it
varied
slightly
in
many
ways
,
then
all
the
variations
which
rendered
the
insect
at
all
more
like
any
such
object
,
and
thus
favoured
its
escape
,
would
be
preserved
,
whilst
other
variations
would
be
neglected
and
ultimately
lost
;
or
,
if
they
rendered
the
insect
at
all
less
like
the
imitated
object
,
they
would
be
eliminated
.
There
would
indeed
be
force
in
Mr
.
Mivart's
objection
,
if
we
were
to
attempt
to
account
for
the
above
resemblances
,
independently
of
natural
selection
,
through
mere
fluctuating
variability
;
but
as
the
case
stands
there
is
none
.
Nor
can
I
see
any
force
in
Mr
.
Mivart's
difficulty
with
respect
to
"
the
last
touches
of
perfection
in
the
mimicry
"
;
as
in
the
case
given
by
Mr
.
Wallace
,
of
a
walking
stick
insect
(
Ceroxylus
laceratus
)
,
which
resembles
"
a
stick
grown
over
by
a
creeping
moss
or
jungermannia
.
"
So
close
was
this
resemblance
,
that
a
native
Dyak
maintained
that
the
foliaceous
excrescences
were
really
moss
.
Insects
are
preyed
on
by
birds
and
other
enemies
,
whose
sight
is
probably
sharper
than
ours
,
and
every
grade
in
resemblance
which
aided
an
insect
to
escape
notice
or
detection
,
would
tend
towards
its
preservation
;
and
the
more
perfect
the
resemblance
so
much
the
better
for
the
insect
.
Considering
the
nature
of
the
differences
between
the
species
in
the
group
which
includes
the
above
Ceroxylus
,
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
this
insect
having
varied
in
the
irregularities
on
its
surface
,
and
in
these
having
become
more
or
less
green
coloured
;
for
in
every
group
the
characters
which
differ
in
the
several
species
are
the
most
apt
to
vary
,
whilst
the
generic
characters
,
or
those
common
to
all
the
species
,
are
the
most
constant
.
The
Greenland
whale
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
animals
in
the
world
,
and
the
baleen
,
or
whale
bone
,
one
of
its
greatest
peculiarities
.
The
baleen
consists
of
a
row
,
on
each
side
of
the
upper
jaw
,
of
about
300
plates
or
laminae
,
which
stand
close
together
transversely
to
the
longer
axis
of
the
mouth
.
Within
the
main
row
there
are
some
subsidiary
rows
.
The
extremities
and
inner
margins
of
all
the
plates
are
frayed
into
stiff
bristles
,
which
clothe
the
whole
gigantic
palate
,
and
serve
to
strain
or
sift
the
water
,
and
thus
to
secure
the
minute
prey
on
which
these
great
animals
subsist
.
The
middle
and
longest
lamina
in
the
Greenland
whale
is
ten
,
twelve
,
or
even
fifteen
feet
in
length
;
but
in
the
different
species
of
cetaceans
there
are
gradations
in
length
;
the
middle
lamina
being
in
one
species
,
according
to
Scoresby
,
four
feet
,
in
another
three
,
in
another
eighteen
inches
,
and
in
the
Balaenoptera
rostrata
only
about
nine
inches
in
length
.
The
quality
of
the
whale
bone
also
differs
in
the
different
species
.
With
respect
to
the
baleen
,
Mr
.
Mivart
remarks
that
if
it
"
had
once
attained
such
a
size
and
development
as
to
be
at
all
useful
,
then
its
preservation
and
augmentation
within
serviceable
limits
would
be
promoted
by
natural
selection
alone
.
But
how
to
obtain
the
beginning
of
such
useful
development
?
"
In
answer
,
it
may
be
asked
,
why
should
not
the
early
progenitors
of
the
whales
with
baleen
have
possessed
a
mouth
constructed
something
like
the
lamellated
beak
of
a
duck
?
Ducks
,
like
whales
,
subsist
by
sifting
the
mud
and
water
;
and
the
family
has
sometimes
been
called
Criblatores
,
or
sifters
.
I
hope
that
I
may
not
be
misconstrued
into
saying
that
the
progenitors
of
whales
did
actually
possess
mouths
lamellated
like
the
beak
of
a
duck
.
I
wish
only
to
show
that
this
is
not
incredible
,
and
that
the
immense
plates
of
baleen
in
the
Greenland
whale
might
have
been
developed
from
such
lamellae
by
finely
graduated
steps
,
each
of
service
to
its
possessor
.
The
beak
of
a
shoveller
duck
(
Spatula
elypedta
)
is
a
more
beautiful
and
complex
structure
than
the
mouth
of
a
whale
.
The
upper
mandible
is
furnished
on
each
side
(
in
the
specimen
examined
by
me
)
with
a
row
or
comb
formed
of
188
thin
,
elastic
lamellae
,
obliquely
bevelled
so
as
to
be
pointed
,
and
placed
transversely
to
the
longer
axis
of
the
mouth
.
They
arise
from
the
palate
,
and
are
attached
by
flexible
membrane
to
the
sides
of
the
mandible
.
Those
standing
towards
the
middle
are
the
longest
,
being
about
one
third
of
an
inch
in
length
,
and
they
project
.
14
of
an
inch
beneath
the
edge
.
At
their
bases
there
is
a
short
subsidiary
row
of
obliquely
transverse
lamellae
.
In
these
several
respects
they
resemble
the
plates
of
baleen
in
the
mouth
of
a
whale
.
But
towards
the
extremity
of
the
beak
they
differ
much
,
as
they
project
inwards
,
instead
of
straight
downwards
.
The
entire
head
of
the
shoveller
,
though
incomparably
less
bulky
,
is
about
one
eighteenth
of
the
length
of
the
head
of
a
moderately
large
Balaenoptera
rostrata
,
in
which
species
the
baleen
is
only
nine
inches
long
;
so
that
if
we
were
to
make
the
head
of
the
shoveller
as
long
as
that
of
the
Balaenoptera
,
the
lamellae
would
be
six
inches
in
length
,
that
is
,
two
thirds
of
the
length
of
the
baleen
in
this
species
of
whale
.
The
lower
mandible
of
the
shoveller
duck
is
furnished
with
lamellae
of
equal
length
with
those
above
,
but
finer
;
and
in
being
thus
furnished
it
differs
conspicuously
from
the
lower
jaw
of
a
whale
,
which
is
destitute
of
baleen
.
On
the
other
hand
the
extremities
of
these
lower
lamellae
are
frayed
into
fine
bristly
points
,
so
that
they
thus
curiously
resemble
the
plates
of
baleen
.
In
the
genus
Prion
,
a
member
of
the
distinct
family
of
the
petrels
,
the
upper
mandible
alone
is
furnished
with
lamellae
,
which
are
well
developed
and
project
beneath
the
margin
;
so
that
the
beak
of
this
bird
resembles
in
this
respect
the
mouth
of
a
whale
.
From
the
highly
developed
structure
of
the
shoveller's
beak
we
may
proceed
(
as
I
have
learnt
from
information
and
specimens
sent
to
me
by
Mr
.
Salvin
)
,
without
any
great
break
,
as
far
as
fitness
for
sifting
is
concerned
,
through
the
beak
of
the
Merganetta
armata
,
and
in
some
respects
through
that
of
the
Aix
sponsa
,
to
the
beak
of
the
common
duck
.
In
this
latter
species
,
the
lamellae
are
much
coarser
than
in
the
shoveller
,
and
are
firmly
attached
to
the
sides
of
the
mandible
;
they
are
only
about
50
in
number
on
each
side
,
and
do
not
project
at
all
beneath
the
margin
.
They
are
square
topped
,
and
are
edged
with
translucent
hardish
tissue
,
as
if
for
crushing
food
.
The
edges
of
the
lower
mandible
are
crossed
by
numerous
fine
ridges
,
which
project
very
little
.
Although
the
beak
is
thus
very
inferior
as
a
sifter
to
that
of
the
shoveller
,
yet
this
bird
,
as
every
one
knows
,
constantly
uses
it
for
this
purpose
.
There
are
other
species
,
as
I
hear
from
Mr
.
Salvin
,
in
which
the
lamellae
are
considerably
less
developed
than
in
the
common
duck
;
but
I
do
not
know
whether
they
use
their
beaks
for
sifting
the
water
.
Turning
to
another
group
of
the
same
family
:
in
the
Egyptian
goose
(
Chenalopex
)
the
beak
closely
resembles
that
of
the
common
ducks
;
but
the
lamellae
are
not
so
numerous
,
nor
so
distinct
from
each
other
,
nor
do
they
project
so
much
inwards
;
yet
this
goose
,
as
I
am
informed
by
Mr
.
E
.
Bartlett
,
"
uses
its
bill
like
a
duck
by
throwing
the
water
out
at
the
corners
.
"
Its
chief
food
,
however
,
is
grass
,
which
it
crops
like
the
common
goose
.
In
this
latter
bird
,
the
lamellae
of
the
upper
mandible
are
much
coarser
than
in
the
common
duck
,
almost
confluent
,
about
27
in
number
on
each
side
,
and
terminating
upwards
in
teeth
like
knobs
.
The
palate
is
also
covered
with
hard
rounded
knobs
.
The
edges
of
the
lower
mandible
are
serrated
with
teeth
much
more
prominent
,
coarser
,
and
sharper
than
in
the
duck
.
The
common
goose
does
not
sift
the
water
,
but
uses
its
beak
exclusively
for
tearing
or
cutting
herbage
,
for
which
purpose
it
is
so
well
fitted
,
that
it
can
crop
grass
closer
than
almost
any
other
animal
.
There
are
other
species
of
geese
,
as
I
hear
from
Mr
.
Bartlett
,
in
which
the
lamellae
are
less
developed
than
in
the
common
goose
.
We
thus
see
that
a
member
of
the
duck
family
,
with
a
beak
constructed
like
that
of
the
common
goose
and
adapted
solely
for
grazing
,
or
even
a
member
with
a
beak
having
less
well
developed
lamellae
,
might
be
converted
by
small
changes
into
a
species
like
the
Egyptian
goose
,
this
into
one
like
the
common
duck
,
and
,
lastly
,
into
one
like
the
shoveller
,
provided
with
a
beak
almost
exclusively
adapted
for
sifting
the
water
;
for
this
bird
could
hardly
use
any
part
of
its
beak
,
except
the
hooked
tip
,
for
seizing
or
tearing
solid
food
.
The
beak
of
a
goose
,
as
I
may
add
,
might
also
be
converted
by
small
changes
into
one
provided
with
prominent
,
recurved
teeth
,
like
those
of
the
merganser
(
a
member
of
the
same
family
)
,
serving
for
the
widely
different
purpose
of
securing
live
fish
.
Returning
to
the
whales
:
the
Hyperoodon
bidens
is
destitute
of
true
teeth
in
an
efficient
condition
,
but
its
palate
is
roughened
,
according
to
Lacepide
,
with
small
,
unequal
,
hard
points
of
horn
.
There
is
,
therefore
,
nothing
improbable
in
supposing
that
some
early
cetacean
form
was
provided
with
similar
points
of
horn
on
the
palate
,
but
rather
more
regularly
placed
,
and
which
,
like
the
knobs
on
the
beak
of
the
goose
,
aided
it
in
seizing
or
tearing
its
food
.
If
so
,
it
will
hardly
be
denied
that
the
points
might
have
been
converted
through
variation
and
natural
selection
into
lamellae
as
well
developed
as
those
of
the
Egyptian
goose
,
in
which
case
they
would
have
been
used
both
for
seizing
objects
and
for
sifting
the
water
;
then
into
lamellae
like
those
of
the
domestic
duck
;
and
so
onwards
,
until
they
became
as
well
constructed
as
those
of
the
shoveller
,
in
which
case
they
would
have
served
exclusively
as
a
sifting
apparatus
.
From
this
stage
,
in
which
the
lamellae
would
be
two
thirds
of
the
length
of
the
plates
of
baleen
in
the
Balaenoptera
rostrata
,
gradations
,
which
may
be
observed
in
still
existing
cetaceans
,
lead
us
onwards
to
the
enormous
plates
of
baleen
in
the
Greenland
whale
.
Nor
is
there
the
least
reason
to
doubt
that
each
step
in
this
scale
might
have
been
as
serviceable
to
certain
ancient
cetaceans
,
with
the
functions
of
the
parts
slowly
changing
during
the
progress
of
development
,
as
are
the
gradations
in
the
beaks
of
the
different
existing
members
of
the
duck
family
.
We
should
bear
in
mind
that
each
species
of
duck
is
subjected
to
a
severe
struggle
for
existence
,
and
that
the
structure
of
every
part
of
its
frame
must
be
well
adapted
to
its
conditions
of
life
.
The
Pleuronectidae
,
or
flat
fish
,
are
remarkable
for
their
asymmetrical
bodies
.
They
rest
on
one
side
,
in
the
greater
number
of
species
on
the
left
,
but
in
some
on
the
right
side
;
and
occasionally
reversed
adult
specimens
occur
.
The
lower
,
or
resting
surface
,
resembles
at
first
sight
the
ventral
surface
of
an
ordinary
fish
:
it
is
of
a
white
colour
,
less
developed
in
many
ways
than
the
upper
side
,
with
the
lateral
fins
often
of
smaller
size
.
But
the
eyes
offer
the
most
remarkable
peculiarity
;
for
they
are
both
placed
on
the
upper
side
of
the
head
.
During
early
youth
,
however
,
they
stand
opposite
to
each
other
,
and
the
whole
body
is
then
symmetrical
,
with
both
sides
equally
coloured
.
Soon
the
eye
proper
to
the
lower
side
begins
to
glide
slowly
round
the
head
to
the
upper
side
;
but
does
not
pass
right
through
the
skull
,
as
was
formerly
thought
to
be
the
case
.
It
is
obvious
that
unless
the
lower
eye
did
thus
travel
round
,
it
could
not
be
used
by
the
fish
whilst
lying
in
its
habitual
position
on
one
side
.
The
lower
eye
would
,
also
,
have
been
liable
to
be
abraded
by
the
sandy
bottom
.
That
the
Pleuronectidae
are
admirably
adapted
by
their
flattened
and
asymmetrical
structure
for
their
habits
of
life
,
is
manifest
from
several
species
,
such
as
soles
,
flounders
,
&c
.
,
being
extremely
common
.
The
chief
advantages
thus
gained
seem
to
be
protection
from
their
enemies
,
and
facility
for
feeding
on
the
ground
.
The
different
members
,
however
,
of
the
family
present
,
as
Schiodte
remarks
,
"
a
long
series
of
forms
exhibiting
a
gradual
transition
from
Hippoglossus
pinguis
,
which
does
not
in
any
considerable
degree
alter
the
shape
in
which
it
leaves
the
ovum
,
to
the
soles
,
which
are
entirely
thrown
to
one
side
.
"
Mr
.
Mivart
has
taken
up
this
case
,
and
remarks
that
a
sudden
spontaneous
transformation
in
the
position
of
the
eyes
is
hardly
conceivable
,
in
which
I
quite
agree
with
him
.
He
then
adds
:
"
If
the
transit
was
gradual
,
then
how
such
transit
of
one
eye
a
minute
fraction
of
the
journey
towards
the
other
side
of
the
head
could
benefit
the
individual
is
,
indeed
,
far
from
clear
.
It
seems
,
even
,
that
such
an
incipient
transformation
must
rather
have
been
injurious
.
"
But
he
might
have
found
an
answer
to
this
objection
in
the
excellent
observations
published
in
1867
by
Malm
.
The
Pleuronectidae
whilst
very
young
and
still
symmetrical
,
with
their
eyes
standing
on
opposite
sides
of
the
head
,
cannot
long
retain
a
vertical
position
,
owing
to
the
excessive
depth
of
their
bodies
,
the
small
size
of
their
lateral
fins
,
and
to
their
being
destitute
of
a
swimbladder
.
Hence
soon
growing
tired
,
they
fall
to
the
bottom
on
one
side
.
Whilst
thus
at
rest
they
often
twist
,
as
Malm
observed
,
the
lower
eye
upwards
,
to
see
above
them
;
and
they
do
this
so
vigorously
that
the
eye
is
pressed
hard
against
the
upper
part
of
the
orbit
.
The
forehead
between
the
eyes
consequently
becomes
,
as
could
be
plainly
seen
,
temporarily
contracted
in
breadth
.
On
one
occasion
Malm
saw
a
young
fish
raise
and
depress
the
lower
eye
through
an
angular
distance
of
about
seventy
degrees
.
We
should
remember
that
the
skull
at
this
early
age
is
cartilaginous
and
flexible
,
so
that
it
readily
yields
to
muscular
action
.
It
is
also
known
with
the
higher
animals
,
even
after
early
youth
,
that
the
skull
yields
and
is
altered
in
shape
,
if
the
skin
or
muscles
be
permanently
contracted
through
disease
or
some
accident
.
With
long
eared
rabbits
,
if
one
ear
lops
forwards
and
downwards
,
its
weight
drags
forward
all
the
bones
of
the
skull
on
the
same
side
,
of
which
I
have
given
a
figure
.
Malm
states
that
the
newly
hatched
young
of
perches
,
salmon
,
and
several
other
symmetrical
fishes
,
have
the
habit
of
occasionally
resting
on
one
side
at
the
bottom
;
and
he
has
observed
that
they
often
then
strain
their
lower
eyes
so
as
to
look
upwards
;
and
their
skulls
are
thus
rendered
rather
crooked
.
These
fishes
,
however
,
are
soon
able
to
hold
themselves
in
a
vertical
position
,
and
no
permanent
effect
is
thus
produced
.
With
the
Pleuronectidae
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
older
they
grow
the
more
habitually
they
rest
on
one
side
,
owing
to
the
increasing
flatness
of
their
bodies
,
and
a
permanent
effect
is
thus
produced
on
the
form
of
the
head
,
and
on
the
position
of
the
eyes
.
Judging
from
analogy
,
the
tendency
to
distortion
would
no
doubt
be
increased
through
the
principle
of
inheritance
.
Schiodte
believes
,
in
opposition
to
some
other
naturalists
,
that
the
Pleuronectidae
are
not
quite
symmetrical
even
in
the
embryo
;
and
if
this
be
so
,
we
could
understand
how
it
is
that
certain
species
,
whilst
young
,
habitually
fall
over
and
rest
on
the
left
side
,
and
other
species
on
the
right
side
.
Malm
adds
,
in
confirmation
of
the
above
view
,
that
the
adult
Trachypterus
arcticus
,
which
is
not
a
member
of
the
Pleuronectidae
,
rests
on
its
left
side
at
the
bottom
,
and
swims
diagonally
through
the
water
;
and
in
this
fish
,
the
two
sides
of
the
head
are
said
to
be
somewhat
dissimilar
.
Our
great
authority
on
fishes
,
Dr
.
Gunther
,
concludes
his
abstract
of
Malm's
paper
,
by
remarking
that
"
the
author
gives
a
very
simple
explanation
of
the
abnormal
condition
of
the
pleuronectoids
.
"
We
thus
see
that
the
first
stages
of
the
transit
of
the
eye
from
one
side
of
the
head
to
the
other
,
which
Mr
.
Mivart
considers
would
be
injurious
,
may
be
attributed
to
the
habit
,
no
doubt
beneficial
to
the
individual
and
to
the
species
,
of
endeavouring
to
look
upwards
with
both
eyes
,
whilst
resting
on
one
side
at
the
bottom
.
We
may
also
attribute
to
the
inherited
effects
of
use
the
fact
of
the
mouth
in
several
kinds
of
flat
fish
being
bent
towards
the
lower
surface
,
with
the
jaw
bones
stronger
and
more
effective
on
this
,
the
eyeless
side
of
the
head
,
than
on
the
other
,
for
the
sake
,
as
Dr
.
Traquair
supposes
,
of
feeding
with
ease
on
the
ground
.
Disuse
,
on
the
other
hand
,
will
account
for
the
less
developed
condition
of
the
whole
inferior
half
of
the
body
,
including
the
lateral
fins
;
though
Yarrel
thinks
that
the
reduced
size
of
these
fins
is
advantageous
to
the
fish
,
as
"
there
is
so
much
less
room
for
their
action
,
than
with
the
larger
fins
above
.
"
Perhaps
the
lesser
number
of
teeth
in
the
proportion
of
four
to
seven
in
the
upper
halves
of
the
two
jaws
of
the
plaice
,
to
twenty
five
to
thirty
in
the
lower
halves
,
may
likewise
be
accounted
for
by
disuse
.
From
the
colourless
state
of
the
ventral
surface
of
most
fishes
and
of
many
other
animals
,
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
absence
of
colour
in
flat
fish
on
the
side
,
whether
it
be
the
right
or
left
,
which
is
undermost
,
is
due
to
the
exclusion
of
light
.
But
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
the
peculiar
speckled
appearance
of
the
upper
side
of
the
sole
,
so
like
the
sandy
bed
of
the
sea
,
or
the
power
in
some
species
,
as
recently
shown
by
Pouchet
,
of
changing
their
colour
in
accordance
with
the
surrounding
surface
,
or
the
presence
of
bony
tubercles
on
the
upper
side
of
the
turbot
,
are
due
to
the
action
of
the
light
.
Here
natural
selection
has
probably
come
into
play
,
as
well
as
in
adapting
the
general
shape
of
the
body
of
these
fishes
,
and
many
other
peculiarities
,
to
their
habits
of
life
.
We
should
keep
in
mind
,
as
I
have
before
insisted
,
that
the
inherited
effects
of
the
increased
use
of
parts
,
and
perhaps
of
their
disuse
,
will
be
strengthened
by
natural
selection
.
For
all
spontaneous
variations
in
the
right
direction
will
thus
be
preserved
;
as
will
those
individuals
which
inherit
in
the
highest
degree
the
effects
of
the
increased
and
beneficial
use
of
any
part
.
How
much
to
attribute
in
each
particular
case
to
the
effects
of
use
,
and
how
much
to
natural
selection
,
it
seems
impossible
to
decide
.
I
may
give
another
instance
of
a
structure
which
apparently
owes
its
origin
exclusively
to
use
or
habit
.
The
extremity
of
the
tail
in
some
American
monkeys
has
been
converted
into
a
wonderfully
perfect
prehensile
organ
,
and
serves
as
a
fifth
hand
.
A
reviewer
who
agrees
with
Mr
.
Mivart
in
every
detail
,
remarks
on
this
structure
:
"
It
is
impossible
to
believe
that
in
any
number
of
ages
the
first
slight
incipient
tendency
to
grasp
could
preserve
the
lives
of
the
individuals
possessing
it
,
or
favour
their
chance
of
having
and
of
rearing
offspring
.
"
But
there
is
no
necessity
for
any
such
belief
.
Habit
,
and
this
almost
implies
that
some
benefit
great
or
small
is
thus
derived
,
would
in
all
probability
suffice
for
the
work
.
Brehm
saw
the
young
of
an
African
monkey
(
Cercopithecus
)
clinging
to
the
under
surface
of
their
mother
by
their
hands
,
and
at
the
same
time
they
hooked
their
little
tails
round
that
of
their
mother
.
Professor
Henslow
kept
in
confinement
some
harvest
mice
(
Mus
messorius
)
which
do
not
possess
a
structurally
prehensile
tail
;
but
he
frequently
observed
that
they
curled
their
tails
round
the
branches
of
a
bush
placed
in
the
cage
,
and
thus
aided
themselves
in
climbing
.
I
have
received
an
analogous
account
from
Dr
.
Gunther
,
who
has
seen
a
mouse
thus
suspend
itself
.
If
the
harvest
mouse
had
been
more
strictly
arboreal
,
it
would
perhaps
have
had
its
tail
rendered
structurally
prehensile
,
as
is
the
case
with
some
members
of
the
same
order
.
Why
Cereopithecus
,
considering
its
habits
whilst
young
,
has
not
become
thus
provided
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
.
It
is
,
however
,
possible
that
the
long
tail
of
this
monkey
may
be
of
more
service
to
it
as
a
balancing
organ
in
making
its
prodigious
leaps
,
than
as
a
prehensile
organ
.
The
mammary
glands
are
common
to
the
whole
class
of
mammals
,
and
are
indispensable
for
their
existence
;
they
must
,
therefore
,
have
been
developed
at
an
extremely
remote
period
,
and
we
can
know
nothing
positively
about
their
manner
of
development
.
Mr
.
Mivart
asks
:
"
Is
it
conceivable
that
the
young
of
any
animal
was
ever
saved
from
destruction
by
accidentally
sucking
a
drop
of
scarcely
nutritious
fluid
from
an
accidentally
hypertrophied
cutaneous
gland
of
its
mother
?
And
even
if
one
was
so
,
what
chance
was
there
of
the
perpetuation
of
such
a
variation
?
"
But
the
case
is
not
here
put
fairly
.
It
is
admitted
by
most
evolutionists
that
mammals
are
descended
from
a
marsupial
form
;
and
if
so
,
the
mammary
glands
will
have
been
at
first
developed
within
the
marsupial
sack
.
In
the
case
of
the
fish
(
Hippocampus
)
the
eggs
are
hatched
,
and
the
young
are
reared
for
a
time
,
within
a
sack
of
this
nature
;
and
an
American
naturalist
,
Mr
.
Lockwood
,
believes
from
what
he
has
seen
of
the
development
of
the
young
,
that
they
are
nourished
by
a
secretion
from
the
cutaneous
glands
of
the
sack
.
Now
with
the
early
progenitors
of
mammals
,
almost
before
they
deserved
to
be
thus
designated
,
is
it
not
at
least
possible
that
the
young
might
have
been
similarly
nourished
?
And
in
this
case
,
the
individuals
which
secreted
a
fluid
,
in
some
degree
or
manner
the
most
nutritious
,
so
as
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
milk
,
would
in
the
long
run
have
reared
a
larger
number
of
well
nourished
offspring
,
than
would
the
individuals
which
secreted
a
poorer
fluid
;
and
thus
the
cutaneous
glands
,
which
are
the
homologues
of
the
mammary
glands
,
would
have
been
improved
or
rendered
more
effective
.
It
accords
with
the
widely
extended
principle
of
specialisation
,
that
the
glands
over
a
certain
space
of
the
sack
should
have
become
more
highly
developed
than
the
remainder
;
and
they
would
then
have
formed
a
breast
,
but
at
first
without
a
nipple
as
we
see
in
the
Ornithorhynchus
,
at
the
base
of
the
mammalian
series
.
Through
what
agency
the
glands
over
a
certain
space
became
more
highly
specialised
than
the
others
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
decide
,
whether
in
part
through
compensation
of
growth
,
the
effects
of
use
,
or
of
natural
selection
.
The
development
of
the
mammary
glands
would
have
been
of
no
service
,
and
could
not
have
been
effected
through
natural
selection
,
unless
the
young
at
the
same
time
were
able
to
partake
of
the
secretion
.
There
is
no
greater
difficulty
in
understanding
how
young
mammals
have
instinctively
learnt
to
suck
the
breast
,
than
in
understanding
how
unhatched
chickens
have
learnt
to
break
the
egg
shell
by
tapping
against
it
with
their
specially
adapted
beaks
;
or
how
a
few
hours
after
leaving
the
shell
they
have
learnt
to
pick
up
grains
of
food
.
In
such
cases
the
most
probable
solution
seems
to
be
,
that
the
habit
was
at
first
acquired
by
practice
at
a
more
advanced
age
,
and
afterwards
transmitted
to
the
offspring
at
an
earlier
age
.
But
the
young
kangaroo
is
said
not
to
suck
,
only
to
cling
to
the
nipple
of
its
mother
,
who
has
the
power
of
injecting
milk
into
the
mouth
of
her
helpless
,
half
formed
offspring
.
On
this
head
,
Mr
.
Mivart
remarks
:
"
Did
no
special
provision
exist
,
the
young
one
must
infallibly
be
choked
by
the
intrusion
of
the
milk
into
the
windpipe
.
But
there
is
a
special
provision
.
The
larynx
is
so
elongated
that
it
rises
up
into
the
posterior
end
of
the
nasal
passage
,
and
is
thus
enabled
to
give
free
entrance
to
the
air
for
the
lungs
,
while
the
milk
passes
harmlessly
on
each
side
of
this
elongated
larynx
,
and
so
safely
attains
the
gullet
behind
it
.
"
Mr
.
Mivart
then
asks
how
did
natural
selection
remove
in
the
adult
kangaroo
(
and
in
most
other
mammals
,
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
descended
from
a
marsupial
form
)
,
"
this
at
least
perfectly
innocent
and
harmless
structure
?
"
It
may
be
suggested
in
answer
that
the
voice
,
which
is
certainly
of
high
importance
to
many
animals
,
could
hardly
have
been
used
with
full
force
as
long
as
the
larynx
entered
the
nasal
passage
;
and
Professor
Flower
has
suggested
to
me
that
this
structure
would
have
greatly
interfered
with
an
animal
swallowing
solid
food
.
We
will
now
turn
for
a
short
space
to
the
lower
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
.
The
Echinodermata
(
star
fishes
,
sea
urchins
,
&c
.
)
are
furnished
with
remarkable
organs
,
called
pedicellariae
,
which
consist
,
when
well
developed
,
of
a
tridactyle
forceps
that
is
,
of
one
formed
of
three
serrated
arms
,
neatly
fitting
together
and
placed
on
the
summit
of
a
flexible
stem
,
moved
by
muscles
.
These
forceps
can
firmly
seize
hold
of
any
object
;
and
Alexander
Agassiz
has
seen
an
Echinus
or
sea
urchin
rapidly
passing
particles
of
excrement
from
forceps
to
forceps
down
certain
lines
of
its
body
,
in
order
that
its
shell
should
not
be
fouled
.
But
there
is
no
doubt
that
besides
removing
dirt
of
all
kinds
,
they
subserve
other
functions
;
and
one
of
these
apparently
is
defence
.
With
respect
to
these
organs
,
Mr
.
Mivart
,
as
on
so
many
previous
occasions
,
asks
:
"
What
would
be
the
utility
of
the
first
rudimentary
beginnings
of
such
structures
,
and
how
could
such
incipient
buddings
have
ever
preserved
the
life
of
a
single
Echinus
?
"
He
adds
,
"
Not
even
the
sudden
development
of
the
snapping
action
could
have
been
beneficial
without
the
freely
moveable
stalk
,
nor
could
the
latter
have
been
efficient
without
the
snapping
jaws
,
yet
no
minute
merely
indefinite
variations
could
simultaneously
evolve
these
complex
co
ordinations
of
structure
;
to
deny
this
seems
to
do
no
less
than
to
affirm
a
startling
paradox
.
"
Paradoxical
as
this
may
appear
to
Mr
.
Mivart
,
tridactyle
forcepses
,
immovably
fixed
at
the
base
,
but
capable
of
a
snapping
action
,
certainly
exist
on
some
starfishes
;
and
this
is
intelligible
if
they
serve
,
at
least
in
part
,
as
a
means
of
defence
.
Mr
.
Agassiz
,
to
whose
great
kindness
I
am
indebted
for
much
information
on
the
subject
,
informs
me
that
there
are
other
star
fishes
,
in
which
one
of
the
three
arms
of
the
forceps
is
reduced
to
a
support
for
the
other
two
;
and
again
,
other
genera
in
which
the
third
arm
is
completely
lost
.
In
Echinoneus
,
the
shell
is
described
by
M
.
Perrier
as
bearing
two
kinds
of
pedicellariae
,
one
resembling
those
of
Echinus
,
and
the
other
those
of
Spatangus
;
and
such
cases
are
always
interesting
as
affording
the
means
of
apparently
sudden
transitions
,
through
the
abortion
of
one
of
the
two
states
of
an
organ
.
With
respect
to
the
steps
by
which
these
curious
organs
have
been
evolved
,
Mr
.
Agassiz
infers
from
his
own
researches
and
those
of
Muller
,
that
both
in
star
fishes
and
sea
urchins
the
pedicellariae
must
undoubtedly
be
looked
at
as
modified
spines
.
This
may
be
inferred
from
their
manner
of
development
in
the
individual
,
as
well
as
from
a
long
and
perfect
series
of
gradations
in
different
species
and
genera
,
from
simple
granules
to
ordinary
spines
,
to
perfect
tridactyle
pedicellariae
.
The
gradations
extend
even
to
the
manner
in
which
ordinary
spines
and
pedicellariae
with
their
supporting
calcareous
rods
are
articulated
to
the
shell
.
In
certain
genera
of
star
fishes
,
"
the
very
combinations
needed
to
show
that
the
pedicellariae
are
only
modified
branching
spines
"
may
be
found
.
Thus
we
have
fixed
spines
,
with
three
equidistant
,
serrated
,
moveable
branches
,
articulated
to
near
their
bases
;
and
higher
up
,
on
the
same
spine
,
three
other
moveable
branches
.
Now
when
the
latter
arise
from
the
summit
of
a
spine
they
form
in
fact
a
rude
tridactyle
pedicellaria
,
and
such
may
be
seen
on
the
same
spine
together
with
the
three
lower
branches
.
In
this
case
the
identity
in
nature
between
the
arms
of
the
pedicellariae
and
the
moveable
branches
of
a
spine
,
is
unmistakable
.
It
is
generally
admitted
that
the
ordinary
spines
serve
as
a
protection
;
and
if
so
,
there
can
be
no
reason
to
doubt
that
those
furnished
with
serrated
and
moveable
branches
likewise
serve
for
the
same
purpose
;
and
they
would
thus
serve
still
more
effectively
as
soon
as
by
meeting
together
they
acted
as
a
prehensile
or
snapping
apparatus
.
Thus
every
gradation
,
from
an
ordinary
fixed
spine
to
a
fixed
pedicellaria
,
would
be
of
service
.
In
certain
genera
of
star
fishes
these
organs
,
instead
of
being
fixed
or
borne
on
an
immoveable
support
,
are
placed
on
the
summit
of
a
flexible
and
muscular
,
though
short
,
stem
;
and
in
this
case
they
probably
subserve
some
additional
function
besides
defence
.
In
the
sea
urchins
the
steps
can
be
followed
by
which
a
fixed
spine
becomes
articulated
to
the
shell
,
and
is
thus
rendered
moveable
.
I
wish
I
had
space
here
to
give
a
fuller
abstract
of
Mr
.
Agassiz's
interesting
observations
on
the
development
of
the
pedicellariae
.
All
possible
gradations
,
as
he
adds
,
may
likewise
be
found
between
the
pedicellariae
of
the
star
fishes
and
the
hooks
of
the
ophiurians
,
another
group
of
Echinodermata
;
and
again
between
the
pedicellariae
of
sea
urchins
and
the
anchors
of
the
Holothuriae
,
also
belonging
to
the
same
great
class
.
Certain
compound
animals
,
or
zoophytes
as
they
have
been
termed
,
namely
the
Polyzoa
,
are
provided
with
curious
organs
called
avicularia
.
These
differ
much
in
structure
in
the
different
species
.
In
their
most
perfect
condition
,
they
curiously
resemble
the
head
and
beak
of
a
vulture
in
miniature
,
seated
on
a
neck
and
capable
of
movement
,
as
is
likewise
the
lower
jaw
or
mandible
.
In
one
species
observed
by
me
all
the
avicularia
on
the
same
branch
often
moved
simultaneously
backwards
and
forwards
,
with
the
lower
jaw
widely
open
,
through
an
angle
of
about
90
degrees
,
in
the
course
of
five
seconds
;
and
their
movement
caused
the
whole
polyzoary
to
tremble
.
When
the
jaws
are
touched
with
a
needle
they
seize
it
so
firmly
that
the
branch
can
thus
be
shaken
.
Mr
.
Mivart
adduces
this
case
,
chiefly
on
account
of
the
supposed
difficulty
of
organs
,
namely
the
avicularia
of
the
Polyzoa
and
the
pedicellariae
of
the
Echinodermata
,
which
he
considers
as
"
essentially
similar
,
"
having
been
developed
through
natural
selection
in
widely
distinct
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
.
But
,
as
far
as
structure
is
concerned
,
I
can
see
no
similarity
between
tridactyle
pedicellariae
and
avicularia
.
The
latter
resemble
somewhat
more
closely
the
chelae
or
pincers
of
crustaceans
;
and
Mr
.
Mivart
might
have
adduced
with
equal
appropriateness
this
resemblance
as
a
special
difficulty
;
or
even
their
resemblance
to
the
head
and
beak
of
a
bird
.
The
avicularia
are
believed
by
Mr
.
Busk
,
Dr
.
Smitt
,
and
Dr
.
Nitsche
naturalists
who
have
carefully
studied
this
group
to
be
homologous
with
the
zooids
and
their
cells
which
compose
the
zoophyte
;
the
moveable
lip
or
lid
of
the
cell
corresponding
with
the
lower
and
moveable
mandible
of
the
avicularium
.
Mr
.
Busk
,
however
,
does
not
know
of
any
gradations
now
existing
between
a
zooid
and
an
avicularium
.
It
is
therefore
impossible
to
conjecture
by
what
serviceable
gradations
the
one
could
have
been
converted
into
the
other
:
but
it
by
no
means
follows
from
this
that
such
gradations
have
not
existed
.
As
the
chelae
of
crustaceans
resemble
in
some
degree
the
avicularia
of
Polyzoa
,
both
serving
as
pincers
,
it
may
be
worth
while
to
show
that
with
the
former
a
long
series
of
serviceable
gradations
still
exists
.
In
the
first
and
simplest
stage
,
the
terminal
segment
of
a
limb
shuts
down
either
on
the
square
summit
of
the
broad
penultimate
segment
,
or
against
one
whole
side
;
and
is
thus
enabled
to
catch
hold
of
an
object
;
but
the
limb
still
serves
as
an
organ
of
locomotion
.
We
next
find
one
corner
of
the
broad
penultimate
segment
slightly
prominent
,
sometimes
furnished
with
irregular
teeth
;
and
against
these
the
terminal
segment
shuts
down
.
By
an
increase
in
the
size
of
this
projection
,
with
its
shape
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
terminal
segment
,
slightly
modified
and
improved
,
the
pincers
are
rendered
more
and
more
perfect
,
until
we
have
at
last
an
instrument
as
efficient
as
the
chelae
of
a
lobster
;
and
all
these
gradations
can
be
actually
traced
.
Besides
the
avicularia
,
the
Polyzoa
possess
curious
organs
called
vibracula
.
These
generally
consist
of
long
bristles
,
capable
of
movement
and
easily
excited
.
In
one
species
examined
by
me
the
vibracula
were
slightly
curved
and
serrated
along
the
outer
margin
;
and
all
of
them
on
the
same
polyzoary
often
moved
simultaneously
;
so
that
,
acting
like
long
oars
,
they
swept
a
branch
rapidly
across
the
object
glass
of
my
microscope
.
When
a
branch
was
placed
on
its
face
,
the
vibracula
became
entangled
,
and
they
made
violent
efforts
to
free
themselves
.
They
are
supposed
to
serve
as
a
defence
,
and
may
be
seen
,
as
Mr
.
Busk
remarks
,
"
to
sweep
slowly
and
carefully
over
the
surface
of
the
polyzoary
,
removing
what
might
be
noxious
to
the
delicate
inhabitants
of
the
cells
when
their
tentacula
are
protruded
.
"
The
avicularia
,
like
the
vibracula
,
probably
serve
for
defence
,
but
they
also
catch
and
kill
small
living
animals
,
which
it
is
believed
are
afterwards
swept
by
the
currents
within
reach
of
the
tentacula
of
the
zooids
.
Some
species
are
provided
with
avicularia
and
vibracula
;
some
with
avicularia
alone
,
and
a
few
with
vibracula
alone
.
It
is
not
easy
to
imagine
two
objects
more
widely
different
in
appearance
than
a
bristle
or
vibraculum
,
and
an
avicularium
like
the
head
of
a
bird
;
yet
they
are
almost
certainly
homologous
and
have
been
developed
from
the
same
common
source
,
namely
a
zooid
with
its
cell
.
Hence
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
these
organs
graduate
in
some
cases
,
as
I
am
informed
by
Mr
.
Busk
,
into
each
other
.
Thus
with
the
avicularia
of
several
species
of
Lepralia
,
the
moveable
mandible
is
so
much
produced
and
is
so
like
a
bristle
,
that
the
presence
of
the
upper
or
fixed
beak
alone
serves
to
determine
even
its
avicularian
nature
.
The
vibracula
may
have
been
directly
developed
from
the
lips
of
the
cells
,
without
having
passed
through
the
avicularian
stage
;
but
it
seems
more
probable
that
they
have
passed
through
this
stage
,
as
during
the
early
stages
of
the
transformation
,
the
other
parts
of
the
cell
with
the
included
zooid
could
hardly
have
disappeared
at
once
.
In
many
cases
the
vibracula
have
a
grooved
support
at
the
base
,
which
seems
to
represent
the
fixed
beak
;
though
this
support
in
some
species
is
quite
absent
.
This
view
of
the
development
of
the
vibracula
,
if
trustworthy
,
is
interesting
;
for
supposing
that
all
the
species
provided
with
avicularia
had
become
extinct
,
no
one
with
the
most
vivid
imagination
would
ever
have
thought
that
the
vibracula
had
originally
existed
as
part
of
an
organ
,
resembling
a
bird's
head
or
an
irregular
box
or
hood
.
It
is
interesting
to
see
two
such
widely
different
organs
developed
from
a
common
origin
;
and
as
the
moveable
lip
of
the
cell
serves
as
a
protection
to
the
zooid
,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
all
the
gradations
,
by
which
the
lip
became
converted
first
into
the
lower
mandible
of
an
avicularium
and
then
into
an
elongated
bristle
,
likewise
served
as
a
protection
in
different
ways
and
under
different
circumstances
.
In
the
vegetable
kingdom
Mr
.
Mivart
only
alludes
to
two
cases
,
namely
the
structure
of
the
flowers
of
orchids
,
and
the
movements
of
climbing
plants
.
With
respect
to
the
former
,
he
says
,
"
The
explanation
of
their
origin
is
deemed
thoroughly
unsatisfactory
utterly
insufficient
to
explain
the
incipient
,
infinitesimal
beginnings
of
structures
which
are
of
utility
only
when
they
are
considerably
developed
.
"
As
I
have
fully
treated
this
subject
in
another
work
,
I
will
here
give
only
a
few
details
on
one
alone
of
the
most
striking
peculiarities
of
the
flowers
of
orchids
,
namely
their
pollinia
.
A
pollinium
when
highly
developed
consists
of
a
mass
of
pollen
grains
,
affixed
to
an
elastic
footstalk
or
caudicle
,
and
this
to
a
little
mass
of
extremely
viscid
matter
.
The
pollinia
are
by
this
means
transported
by
insects
from
one
flower
to
the
stigma
of
another
.
In
some
orchids
there
is
no
caudicle
to
the
pollen
masses
,
and
the
grains
are
merely
tied
together
by
fine
threads
;
but
as
these
are
not
confined
to
orchids
,
they
need
not
here
be
considered
;
yet
I
may
mention
that
at
the
base
of
the
orchidaceous
series
,
in
Cypripedium
,
we
can
see
how
the
threads
were
probably
first
developed
.
In
other
orchids
the
threads
cohere
at
one
end
of
the
pollen
masses
;
and
this
forms
the
first
or
nascent
trace
of
a
caudicle
.
That
this
is
the
origin
of
the
caudicle
,
even
when
of
considerable
length
and
highly
developed
,
we
have
good
evidence
in
the
aborted
pollen
grains
which
can
sometimes
be
detected
embedded
within
the
central
and
solid
parts
.
With
respect
to
the
second
chief
peculiarity
,
namely
the
little
mass
of
viscid
matter
attached
to
the
end
of
the
caudicle
,
a
long
series
of
gradations
can
be
specified
,
each
of
plain
service
to
the
plant
.
In
most
flowers
belonging
to
other
orders
the
stigma
secretes
a
little
viscid
matter
.
Now
in
certain
orchids
similar
viscid
matter
is
secreted
,
but
in
much
larger
quantities
by
one
alone
of
the
three
stigmas
;
and
this
stigma
,
perhaps
in
consequence
of
the
copious
secretion
,
is
rendered
sterile
.
When
an
insect
visits
a
flower
of
this
kind
,
it
rubs
off
some
of
the
viscid
matter
and
thus
at
the
same
time
drags
away
some
of
the
pollen
grains
.
From
this
simple
condition
,
which
differs
but
little
from
that
of
a
multitude
of
common
flowers
,
there
are
endless
gradations
,
to
species
in
which
the
pollen
mass
terminates
in
a
very
short
,
free
caudicle
,
to
others
in
which
the
caudicle
becomes
firmly
attached
to
the
viscid
matter
,
with
the
sterile
stigma
itself
much
modified
.
In
this
latter
case
we
have
a
pollinium
in
its
most
highly
developed
and
perfect
condition
.
He
who
will
carefully
examine
the
flowers
of
orchids
for
himself
will
not
deny
the
existence
of
the
above
series
of
gradations
from
a
mass
of
pollen
grains
merely
tied
together
by
threads
,
with
the
stigma
differing
but
little
from
that
of
an
ordinary
flower
,
to
a
highly
complex
pollinium
,
admirably
adapted
for
transportal
by
insects
;
nor
will
he
deny
that
all
the
gradations
in
the
several
species
are
admirably
adapted
in
relation
to
the
general
structure
of
each
flower
for
its
fertilisation
by
different
insects
.
In
this
,
and
in
almost
every
other
case
,
the
enquiry
may
be
pushed
further
backwards
;
and
it
may
be
asked
how
did
the
stigma
of
an
ordinary
flower
become
viscid
,
but
as
we
do
not
know
the
full
history
of
any
one
group
of
beings
,
it
is
as
useless
to
ask
,
as
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
answering
,
such
questions
.
We
will
now
turn
to
climbing
plants
.
These
can
be
arranged
in
a
long
series
,
from
those
which
simply
twine
round
a
support
,
to
those
which
I
have
called
leaf
climbers
,
and
to
those
provided
with
tendrils
.
In
these
two
latter
classes
the
stems
have
generally
,
but
not
always
,
lost
the
power
of
twining
,
though
they
retain
the
power
of
revolving
,
which
the
tendrils
likewise
possess
.
The
gradations
from
leaf
climbers
to
tendril
bearers
are
wonderfully
close
,
and
certain
plants
may
be
indifferently
placed
in
either
class
.
But
in
ascending
the
series
from
simple
twiners
to
leaf
climbers
,
an
important
quality
is
added
,
namely
sensitiveness
to
a
touch
,
by
which
means
the
foot
stalks
of
the
leaves
or
flowers
,
or
these
modified
and
converted
into
tendrils
,
are
excited
to
bend
round
and
clasp
the
touching
object
.
He
who
will
read
my
memoir
on
these
plants
will
,
I
think
,
admit
that
all
the
many
gradations
in
function
and
structure
between
simple
twiners
and
tendril
bearers
are
in
each
case
beneficial
in
a
high
degree
to
the
species
.
For
instance
,
it
is
clearly
a
great
advantage
to
a
twining
plant
to
become
a
leaf
climber
;
and
it
is
probable
that
every
twiner
which
possessed
leaves
with
long
foot
stalks
would
have
been
developed
into
a
leaf
climber
if
the
footstalks
had
possessed
in
any
slight
degree
the
requisite
sensitiveness
to
a
touch
.
As
twining
is
the
simplest
means
of
ascending
a
support
,
and
forms
the
basis
of
our
series
,
it
may
naturally
be
asked
how
did
plants
acquire
this
power
in
an
incipient
degree
,
afterwards
to
be
improved
and
increased
through
natural
selection
.
The
power
of
twining
depends
,
firstly
,
on
the
stems
whilst
young
being
extremely
flexible
(
but
this
is
a
character
common
to
many
plants
which
are
not
climbers
)
;
and
,
secondly
,
on
their
continually
bending
to
all
points
of
the
compass
,
one
after
the
other
in
succession
,
in
the
same
order
.
By
this
movement
the
stems
are
inclined
to
all
sides
,
and
are
made
to
move
round
and
round
.
As
soon
as
the
lower
part
of
a
stem
strikes
against
any
object
and
is
stopped
,
the
upper
part
still
goes
on
bending
and
revolving
,
and
thus
necessarily
twines
round
and
up
the
support
.
The
revolving
movement
ceases
after
the
early
growth
of
each
shoot
.
As
in
many
widely
separated
families
of
plants
,
single
species
and
single
genera
possess
the
power
of
revolving
,
and
have
thus
become
twiners
,
they
must
have
independently
acquired
it
,
and
cannot
have
inherited
it
from
a
common
progenitor
.
Hence
I
was
led
to
predict
that
some
slight
tendency
to
a
movement
of
this
kind
would
be
found
to
be
far
from
uncommon
with
plants
which
did
not
climb
;
and
that
this
had
afforded
the
basis
for
natural
selection
to
work
on
and
improve
.
When
I
made
this
prediction
,
I
knew
of
only
one
imperfect
case
,
namely
,
of
the
young
flower
peduncles
of
a
Maurandia
which
revolved
slightly
and
irregularly
,
like
the
stems
of
twining
plants
,
but
without
making
any
use
of
this
habit
.
Soon
afterwards
Fritz
Muller
discovered
that
the
young
stems
of
an
Alisima
and
of
a
Linum
,
plants
which
do
not
climb
and
are
widely
separated
in
the
natural
system
,
revolved
plainly
,
though
irregularly
;
and
he
states
that
he
has
reason
to
suspect
that
this
occurs
with
some
other
plants
.
These
slight
movements
appear
to
be
of
no
service
to
the
plants
in
question
;
anyhow
,
they
are
not
of
the
least
use
in
the
way
of
climbing
,
which
is
the
point
that
concerns
us
.
Nevertheless
we
can
see
that
if
the
stems
of
these
plants
had
been
flexible
,
and
if
under
the
conditions
to
which
they
are
exposed
it
had
profited
them
to
ascend
to
a
height
,
then
the
habit
of
slightly
and
irregularly
revolving
might
have
been
increased
and
utilised
through
natural
selection
,
until
they
had
become
converted
into
well
developed
twining
species
.
With
respect
to
the
sensitiveness
of
the
footstalks
of
the
leaves
and
flowers
,
and
of
tendrils
,
nearly
the
same
remarks
are
applicable
as
in
the
case
of
the
revolving
movements
of
twining
plants
.
As
a
vast
number
of
species
,
belonging
to
widely
distinct
groups
,
are
endowed
with
this
kind
of
sensitiveness
,
it
ought
to
be
found
in
a
nascent
condition
in
many
plants
which
have
not
become
climbers
.
This
is
the
case
:
I
observed
that
the
young
flower
peduncles
of
the
above
Maurandia
curved
themselves
a
little
toward
the
side
which
was
touched
.
Morren
found
in
several
species
of
Oxalis
that
the
leaves
and
their
foot
stalks
moved
,
especially
after
exposure
to
a
hot
sun
,
when
they
were
gently
and
repeatedly
touched
,
or
when
the
plant
was
shaken
.
I
repeated
these
observations
on
some
other
species
of
Oxalis
with
the
same
result
;
in
some
of
them
the
movement
was
distinct
,
but
was
best
seen
in
the
young
leaves
;
in
others
it
was
extremely
slight
.
It
is
a
more
important
fact
that
according
to
the
high
authority
of
Hofmeister
,
the
young
shoots
and
leaves
of
all
plants
move
after
being
shaken
;
and
with
climbing
plants
it
is
,
as
we
know
,
only
during
the
early
stages
of
growth
that
the
foot
stalks
and
tendrils
are
sensitive
.
It
is
scarcely
possible
that
the
above
slight
movements
,
due
to
a
touch
or
shake
,
in
the
young
and
growing
organs
of
plants
,
can
be
of
any
functional
importance
to
them
.
But
plants
possess
,
in
obedience
to
various
stimuli
,
powers
of
movement
,
which
are
of
manifest
importance
to
them
;
for
instance
,
towards
and
more
rarely
from
the
light
,
in
opposition
to
,
and
more
rarely
in
the
direction
of
,
the
attraction
of
gravity
.
When
the
nerves
and
muscles
of
an
animal
are
excited
by
galvanism
or
by
the
absorption
of
strychnine
,
the
consequent
movements
may
be
called
an
incidental
result
,
for
the
nerves
and
muscles
have
not
been
rendered
specially
sensitive
to
these
stimuli
.
So
with
plants
it
appears
that
,
from
having
the
power
of
movement
in
obedience
to
certain
stimuli
,
they
are
excited
in
an
incidental
manner
by
a
touch
,
or
by
being
shaken
.
Hence
there
is
no
great
difficulty
in
admitting
that
in
the
case
of
leaf
climbers
and
tendril
bearers
,
it
is
this
tendency
which
has
been
taken
advantage
of
and
increased
through
natural
selection
.
It
is
,
however
,
probable
,
from
reasons
which
I
have
assigned
in
my
memoir
,
that
this
will
have
occurred
only
with
plants
which
had
already
acquired
the
power
of
revolving
,
and
had
thus
become
twiners
.
I
have
already
endeavoured
to
explain
how
plants
became
twiners
,
namely
,
by
the
increase
of
a
tendency
to
slight
and
irregular
revolving
movements
,
which
were
at
first
of
no
use
to
them
;
this
movement
,
as
well
as
that
due
to
a
touch
or
shake
,
being
the
incidental
result
of
the
power
of
moving
,
gained
for
other
and
beneficial
purposes
.
Whether
,
during
the
gradual
development
of
climbing
plants
,
natural
selection
has
been
aided
by
the
inherited
effects
of
use
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
decide
;
but
we
know
that
certain
periodical
movements
,
for
instance
the
so
called
sleep
of
plants
,
are
governed
by
habit
.
I
have
now
considered
enough
,
perhaps
more
than
enough
,
of
the
cases
,
selected
with
care
by
a
skilful
naturalist
,
to
prove
that
natural
selection
is
incompetent
to
account
for
the
incipient
stages
of
useful
structures
;
and
I
have
shown
,
as
I
hope
,
that
there
is
no
great
difficulty
on
this
head
.
A
good
opportunity
has
thus
been
afforded
for
enlarging
a
little
on
gradations
of
structure
,
often
associated
with
changed
functions
,
an
important
subject
which
was
not
treated
at
sufficient
length
in
the
former
editions
of
this
work
.
I
will
now
briefly
recapitulate
the
foregoing
cases
.
With
the
giraffe
,
the
continued
preservation
of
the
individuals
of
some
extinct
high
reaching
ruminant
,
which
had
the
longest
necks
,
legs
,
&c
.
,
and
could
browse
a
little
above
the
average
height
,
and
the
continued
destruction
of
those
which
could
not
browse
so
high
,
would
have
sufficed
for
the
production
of
this
remarkable
quadruped
;
but
the
prolonged
use
of
all
the
parts
together
with
inheritance
will
have
aided
in
an
important
manner
in
their
co
ordination
.
With
the
many
insects
which
imitate
various
objects
,
there
is
no
improbability
in
the
belief
that
an
accidental
resemblance
to
some
common
object
was
in
each
case
the
foundation
for
the
work
of
natural
selection
,
since
perfected
through
the
occasional
preservation
of
slight
variations
which
ma
de
the
resemblance
at
all
closer
;
and
this
will
have
been
carried
on
as
long
as
the
insect
continued
to
vary
,
and
as
long
as
a
more
and
more
perfect
resemblance
led
to
its
escape
from
sharp
sighted
enemies
.
In
certain
species
of
whales
there
is
a
tendency
to
the
formation
of
irregular
little
points
of
horn
on
the
palate
;
and
it
seems
to
be
quite
within
the
scope
of
natural
selection
to
preserve
all
favourable
variations
,
until
the
points
were
converted
first
into
lamellated
knobs
or
teeth
,
like
those
on
the
beak
of
a
goose
,
then
into
short
lamellae
,
like
those
of
the
domestic
ducks
,
and
then
into
lamellae
,
as
perfect
as
those
of
the
shoveller
duck
,
and
finally
into
the
gigantic
plates
of
baleen
,
as
in
the
mouth
of
the
Greenland
whale
.
In
the
family
of
the
ducks
,
the
lamellae
are
first
used
as
teeth
,
then
partly
as
teeth
,
and
partly
as
a
sifting
apparatus
,
and
at
last
almost
exclusively
for
this
latter
purpose
.
With
such
structures
as
the
above
lamellae
of
horn
or
whalebone
,
habit
or
use
can
have
done
little
or
nothing
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
towards
their
development
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
transportal
of
the
lower
eye
of
a
flat
fish
to
the
upper
side
of
the
head
,
and
the
formation
of
a
prehensile
tail
,
may
be
attributed
almost
wholly
to
continued
use
,
together
with
inheritance
.
With
respect
to
the
mammae
of
the
higher
animals
,
the
most
probable
conjecture
is
that
primordially
the
cutaneous
glands
over
the
whole
surface
of
a
marsupial
sack
secreted
a
nutritious
fluid
;
and
that
these
glands
were
improved
in
function
through
natural
selection
,
and
concentrated
into
a
confined
area
,
in
which
case
they
would
have
formed
a
mamma
.
There
is
no
more
difficulty
in
understanding
how
the
branched
spines
of
some
ancient
echinoderm
,
which
served
as
a
defence
,
became
developed
through
natural
selection
into
tridactyle
pedicellariae
,
than
in
understanding
the
development
of
the
pincers
of
crustaceans
,
through
slight
,
serviceable
modifications
in
the
ultimate
and
penultimate
segments
of
a
limb
,
which
was
at
first
used
solely
for
locomotion
.
In
the
avicularia
and
vibracula
of
the
Polyzoa
we
have
organs
widely
different
in
appearance
developed
from
the
same
source
;
and
with
the
vibracula
we
can
understand
how
the
successive
gradations
might
have
been
of
service
.
With
the
pollinia
of
orchids
,
the
threads
which
originally
served
to
tie
together
the
pollen
grains
,
can
be
traced
cohering
into
caudicles
;
and
the
steps
can
likewise
be
followed
by
which
viscid
matter
,
such
as
that
secreted
by
the
stigmas
of
ordinary
flowers
,
and
still
subserving
nearly
but
not
quite
the
same
purpose
,
became
attached
to
the
free
ends
of
the
caudicles
;
all
these
gradations
being
of
modest
benefit
to
the
plants
in
question
.
With
respect
to
climbing
plants
,
I
need
not
repeat
what
has
been
so
lately
said
.
It
has
often
been
asked
,
if
natural
selection
be
so
potent
,
why
has
not
this
or
that
structure
been
gained
by
certain
species
,
to
which
it
would
apparently
have
been
advantageous
?
But
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
a
precise
answer
to
such
questions
,
considering
our
ignorance
of
the
past
history
of
each
species
,
and
of
the
conditions
which
at
the
present
day
determine
its
numbers
and
range
.
In
most
cases
only
general
reasons
,
but
in
some
few
cases
special
reasons
,
can
be
assigned
.
Thus
to
adapt
a
species
to
new
habits
of
life
,
many
co
ordinated
modifications
are
almost
indispensable
,
and
it
may
often
have
happened
that
the
requisite
parts
did
not
vary
in
the
right
manner
or
to
the
right
degree
.
Many
species
must
have
been
prevented
from
increasing
in
numbers
through
destructive
agencies
,
which
stood
in
no
relation
to
certain
structures
,
which
we
imagine
would
have
been
gained
through
natural
selection
from
appearing
to
us
advantageous
to
the
species
.
In
this
case
,
as
the
struggle
for
life
did
not
depend
on
such
structures
,
they
could
not
have
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
.
In
many
cases
complex
and
long
enduring
conditions
,
often
of
a
peculiar
nature
,
are
necessary
for
the
development
of
a
structure
;
and
the
requisite
conditions
may
seldom
have
concurred
.
The
belief
that
any
given
structure
,
which
we
think
,
often
erroneously
,
would
have
been
beneficial
to
a
species
,
would
have
been
gained
under
all
circumstances
through
natural
selection
,
is
opposed
to
what
we
can
understand
of
its
manner
of
action
.
Mr
.
Mivart
does
not
deny
that
natural
selection
has
effected
something
;
but
he
considers
it
as
"
demonstrably
insufficient
"
to
account
for
the
phenomena
which
I
explain
by
its
agency
.
His
chief
arguments
have
now
been
considered
,
and
the
others
will
hereafter
be
considered
.
They
seem
to
me
to
partake
little
of
the
character
of
demonstration
,
and
to
have
little
weight
in
comparison
with
those
in
favour
of
the
power
of
natural
selection
,
aided
by
the
other
agencies
often
specified
.
I
am
bound
to
add
,
that
some
of
the
facts
and
arguments
here
used
by
me
,
have
been
advanced
for
the
same
purpose
in
an
able
article
lately
published
in
the
Medico
Chirurgical
Review
.
At
the
present
day
almost
all
naturalists
admit
evolution
under
some
form
.
Mr
.
Mivart
believes
that
species
change
through
"
an
internal
force
or
tendency
,
"
about
which
it
is
not
pretended
that
anything
is
known
.
That
species
have
a
capacity
for
change
will
be
admitted
by
all
evolutionists
;
but
there
is
no
need
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
to
invoke
any
internal
force
beyond
the
tendency
to
ordinary
variability
,
which
through
the
aid
of
selection
by
man
has
given
rise
to
many
well
adapted
domestic
races
,
and
which
through
the
aid
of
natural
selection
would
equally
well
give
rise
by
graduated
steps
to
natural
races
or
species
.
The
final
result
will
generally
have
been
,
as
already
explained
,
an
advance
,
but
in
some
few
cases
a
retrogression
,
in
organisation
.
Mr
.
Mivart
is
further
inclined
to
believe
,
and
some
naturalists
agree
with
him
,
that
new
species
manifest
themselves
"
with
suddenness
and
by
modifications
appearing
at
once
.
"
For
instance
,
he
supposes
that
the
differences
between
the
extinct
three
toed
Hipparion
and
the
horse
arose
suddenly
.
He
thinks
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
wing
of
a
bird
"
was
developed
in
any
other
way
than
by
a
comparatively
sudden
modification
of
a
marked
and
important
kind
"
;
and
apparently
he
would
extend
the
same
view
to
the
wings
of
bats
and
pterodactyles
.
This
conclusion
,
which
implies
great
breaks
or
discontinuity
in
the
series
,
appears
to
me
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
.
Every
one
who
believes
in
slow
and
gradual
evolution
,
will
of
course
admit
that
specific
changes
may
have
been
as
abrupt
and
as
great
as
any
single
variation
which
we
meet
with
under
nature
,
or
even
under
domestication
.
But
as
species
are
more
variable
when
domesticated
or
cultivated
than
under
their
natural
conditions
,
it
is
not
probable
that
such
great
and
abrupt
variations
have
often
occurred
under
nature
,
as
are
known
occasionally
to
arise
under
domestication
.
Of
these
latter
variations
several
may
be
attributed
to
reversion
;
and
the
characters
which
thus
reappear
were
,
it
is
probable
,
in
many
cases
at
first
gained
in
a
gradual
manner
.
A
still
greater
number
must
be
called
monstrosities
,
such
as
six
fingered
men
,
porcupine
men
,
Ancon
sheep
,
Niata
cattle
,
&c
.
;
and
as
they
are
widely
different
in
character
from
natural
species
,
they
throw
very
little
light
on
our
subject
.
Excluding
such
cases
of
abrupt
variations
,
the
few
which
remain
would
at
best
constitute
,
if
found
in
a
state
of
nature
,
doubtful
species
,
closely
related
to
their
parental
types
.
My
reasons
for
doubting
whether
natural
species
have
changed
as
abruptly
as
have
occasionally
domestic
races
,
and
for
entirely
disbelieving
that
they
have
changed
in
the
wonderful
manner
indicated
by
Mr
.
Mivart
,
are
as
follows
.
According
to
our
experience
,
abrupt
and
strongly
marked
variations
occur
in
our
domesticated
productions
,
singly
and
at
rather
long
intervals
of
time
.
If
such
occurred
under
nature
,
they
would
be
liable
,
as
formerly
explained
,
to
be
lost
by
accidental
causes
of
destruction
and
by
subsequent
inter
crossing
;
and
so
it
is
known
to
be
under
domestication
,
unless
abrupt
variations
of
this
kind
are
specially
preserved
and
separated
by
the
care
of
man
.
Hence
in
order
that
a
new
species
should
suddenly
appear
in
the
manner
supposed
by
Mr
.
Mivart
,
it
is
almost
necessary
to
believe
,
in
opposition
to
all
analogy
,
that
several
wonderfully
changed
individuals
appeared
simultaneously
within
the
same
district
.
This
difficulty
,
as
in
the
case
of
unconscious
selection
by
man
,
is
avoided
on
the
theory
of
gradual
evolution
,
through
the
preservation
of
a
large
number
of
individuals
,
which
varied
more
or
less
in
any
favourable
direction
,
and
of
the
destruction
of
a
large
number
which
varied
in
an
opposite
manner
.
That
many
species
have
been
evolved
in
an
extremely
gradual
manner
,
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
.
The
species
and
even
the
genera
of
many
large
natural
families
are
so
closely
allied
together
,
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
not
a
few
of
them
.
On
every
continent
in
proceeding
from
north
to
south
,
from
lowland
to
upland
,
&c
.
,
we
meet
with
a
host
of
closely
related
or
representative
species
;
as
we
likewise
do
on
certain
distinct
continents
,
which
we
have
reason
to
believe
were
formerly
connected
.
But
in
making
these
and
the
following
remarks
,
I
am
compelled
to
allude
to
subjects
hereafter
to
be
discussed
.
Look
at
the
many
outlying
islands
round
a
continent
,
and
see
how
many
of
their
inhabitants
can
be
raised
only
to
the
rank
of
doubtful
species
.
So
it
is
if
we
look
to
past
times
,
and
compare
the
species
which
have
just
passed
away
with
those
still
living
within
the
same
areas
;
or
if
we
compare
the
fossil
species
embedded
in
the
sub
stages
of
the
same
geological
formation
.
It
is
indeed
manifest
that
multitudes
of
species
are
related
in
the
closest
manner
to
other
species
that
still
exist
,
or
have
lately
existed
;
and
it
will
hardly
be
maintained
that
such
species
have
been
developed
in
an
abrupt
or
sudden
manner
.
Nor
should
it
be
forgotten
,
when
we
look
to
the
special
parts
of
allied
species
,
instead
of
to
distinct
species
,
that
numerous
and
wonderfully
fine
gradations
can
be
traced
,
connecting
together
widely
different
structures
.
Many
large
groups
of
facts
are
intelligible
only
on
the
principle
that
species
have
been
evolved
by
very
small
steps
:
for
instance
,
the
fact
that
the
species
included
in
the
larger
genera
are
more
closely
related
to
each
other
,
and
present
a
greater
number
of
varieties
than
do
the
species
in
the
smaller
genera
.
The
former
are
also
grouped
in
little
clusters
,
like
varieties
round
species
,
and
they
present
other
analogies
with
varieties
,
as
was
shown
in
our
second
chapter
.
On
this
same
principle
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
characters
;
and
how
the
parts
which
are
developed
in
an
extraordinary
degree
or
manner
are
more
variable
than
other
parts
of
the
same
species
.
Many
analogous
facts
,
all
pointing
in
the
same
direction
,
could
be
added
.
Although
very
many
species
have
almost
certainly
been
produced
by
steps
not
greater
than
those
separating
fine
varieties
;
yet
it
may
be
maintained
that
some
have
been
developed
in
a
different
and
abrupt
manner
.
Such
an
admission
,
however
,
ought
not
to
be
made
without
strong
evidence
being
assigned
.
The
vague
and
in
some
respects
false
analogies
,
as
they
have
been
shown
to
be
by
Mr
.
Chauncey
Wright
,
which
have
been
advanced
in
favour
of
this
view
,
such
as
the
sudden
crystallisation
of
inorganic
substances
,
or
the
falling
of
a
facetted
spheroid
from
one
facet
to
another
,
hardly
deserve
consideration
.
One
class
of
facts
,
however
,
namely
,
the
sudden
appearance
of
new
and
distinct
forms
of
life
in
our
geological
formations
,
supports
at
first
sight
the
belief
in
abrupt
development
.
But
the
value
of
this
evidence
depends
entirely
on
the
perfection
of
the
geological
record
,
in
relation
to
periods
remote
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
If
the
record
is
as
fragmentary
as
many
geologists
strenuously
assert
,
there
is
nothing
strange
in
new
forms
appearing
as
if
suddenly
developed
.
Unless
we
admit
transformations
as
prodigious
as
those
advocated
by
Mr
.
Mivart
,
such
as
the
sudden
development
of
the
wings
of
birds
or
bats
,
or
the
sudden
conversion
of
a
Hipparion
into
a
horse
,
hardly
any
light
is
thrown
by
the
belief
in
abrupt
modifications
on
the
deficiency
of
connecting
links
in
our
geological
formations
.
But
against
the
belief
in
such
abrupt
changes
,
embryology
enters
a
strong
protest
.
It
is
notorious
that
the
wings
of
birds
and
bats
,
and
the
legs
of
horses
or
other
quadrupeds
,
are
undistinguishable
at
an
early
embryonic
period
,
and
that
they
become
differentiated
by
insensibly
fine
steps
.
Embryological
resemblances
of
all
kinds
can
be
accounted
for
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
by
the
progenitors
of
our
existing
species
having
varied
after
early
youth
,
and
having
transmitted
their
newly
acquired
characters
to
their
offspring
,
at
a
corresponding
age
.
The
embryo
is
thus
left
almost
unaffected
,
and
serves
as
a
record
of
the
past
condition
of
the
species
.
Hence
it
is
that
existing
species
during
the
early
stages
of
their
development
so
often
resemble
ancient
and
extinct
forms
belonging
to
the
same
class
.
On
this
view
of
the
meaning
of
embryological
resemblances
,
and
indeed
on
any
view
,
it
is
incredible
that
an
animal
should
have
undergone
such
momentous
and
abrupt
transformations
,
as
those
above
indicated
;
and
yet
should
not
bear
even
a
trace
in
its
embryonic
condition
of
any
sudden
modification
;
every
detail
in
its
structure
being
developed
by
insensibly
fine
steps
.
He
who
believes
that
some
ancient
form
was
transformed
suddenly
through
an
internal
force
or
tendency
into
,
for
instance
,
one
furnished
with
wings
,
will
be
almost
compelled
to
assume
,
in
opposition
to
all
analogy
,
that
many
individuals
varied
simultaneously
.
It
cannot
be
denied
that
such
abrupt
and
great
changes
of
structure
are
widely
different
from
those
which
most
species
apparently
have
undergone
.
He
will
further
be
compelled
to
believe
that
many
structures
beautifully
adapted
to
all
the
other
parts
of
the
same
creature
and
to
the
surrounding
conditions
,
have
been
suddenly
produced
;
and
of
such
complex
and
wonderful
co
adaptations
,
he
will
not
be
able
to
assign
a
shadow
of
an
explanation
.
He
will
be
forced
to
admit
that
these
great
and
sudden
transformations
have
left
no
trace
of
their
action
on
the
embryo
.
To
admit
all
this
is
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
to
enter
into
the
realms
of
miracle
,
and
to
leave
those
of
Science
.
CHAPTER
VIII
INSTINCT
MANY
instincts
are
so
wonderful
that
their
development
will
probably
appear
to
the
reader
a
difficulty
sufficient
to
overthrow
my
whole
theory
.
I
may
here
premise
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
origin
of
the
mental
powers
,
any
more
than
I
have
with
that
of
life
itself
.
We
are
concerned
only
with
the
diversities
of
instinct
and
of
the
other
mental
faculties
in
animals
of
the
same
class
.
I
will
not
attempt
any
definition
of
instinct
.
It
would
be
easy
to
show
that
several
distinct
mental
actions
are
commonly
embraced
by
this
term
;
but
every
one
understands
what
is
meant
,
when
it
is
said
that
instinct
impels
the
cuckoo
to
migrate
and
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
.
An
action
,
which
we
ourselves
require
experience
to
enable
us
to
perform
,
when
performed
by
an
animal
,
more
especially
by
a
very
young
one
,
without
experience
,
and
when
performed
by
many
individuals
in
the
same
way
,
without
their
knowing
for
what
purpose
it
is
performed
,
is
usually
said
to
be
instinctive
.
But
I
could
show
that
none
of
these
characters
are
universal
.
A
little
dose
of
judgment
or
reason
,
as
Pierre
Huber
expresses
it
,
often
comes
into
play
,
even
with
animals
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
.
Frederic
Cuvier
and
several
of
the
older
metaphysicians
have
compared
instinct
with
habit
.
This
comparison
gives
,
I
think
,
an
accurate
notion
of
the
frame
of
mind
under
which
an
instinctive
action
is
performed
,
but
not
necessarily
of
its
origin
.
How
unconsciously
many
habitual
actions
are
performed
,
indeed
not
rarely
in
direct
opposition
to
our
conscious
will!
Yet
they
may
be
modified
by
the
will
or
reason
.
Habits
easily
become
associated
with
other
habits
,
with
certain
periods
of
time
,
and
states
of
the
body
.
When
once
acquired
,
they
often
remain
constant
throughout
life
.
Several
other
points
of
resemblance
between
instincts
and
habits
could
be
pointed
out
.
As
in
repeating
a
well
known
song
,
so
in
instincts
,
one
action
follows
another
by
a
sort
of
rhythm
;
if
a
person
be
interrupted
in
a
song
,
or
in
repeating
anything
by
rote
,
he
is
generally
forced
to
go
back
to
recover
the
habitual
train
of
thought
;
so
P
.
Huber
found
it
was
with
a
caterpillar
,
which
makes
a
very
complicated
hammock
;
for
if
he
took
a
caterpillar
which
had
completed
its
hammock
up
to
,
say
,
the
sixth
stage
of
construction
,
and
put
it
into
a
hammock
completed
up
only
to
the
third
stage
,
the
caterpillar
simply
reperformed
the
fourth
,
fifth
,
and
sixth
stages
of
construction
.
if
,
however
,
a
caterpillar
were
taken
out
of
a
hammock
made
up
,
for
instance
,
to
the
third
stage
,
and
were
put
into
one
finished
up
to
the
sixth
stage
,
so
that
much
of
its
work
was
already
done
for
it
,
far
from
deriving
any
benefit
from
this
,
it
was
much
embarrassed
,
and
in
order
to
complete
its
hammock
,
seemed
forced
to
start
from
the
third
stage
,
where
it
had
left
off
,
and
thus
tried
to
complete
the
already
finished
work
.
If
we
suppose
any
habitual
action
to
become
inherited
and
it
can
be
shown
that
this
does
sometimes
happen
then
the
resemblance
between
what
originally
was
a
habit
and
an
instinct
becomes
so
close
as
not
to
be
distinguished
.
If
Mozart
,
instead
of
playing
the
pianoforte
at
three
years
old
with
wonderfully
little
practice
,
had
played
a
tune
with
no
practice
at
all
,
he
might
truly
be
said
to
have
done
so
instinctively
.
But
it
would
be
a
serious
error
to
suppose
that
the
greater
number
of
instincts
have
been
acquired
by
habit
in
one
generation
,
and
then
transmitted
by
inheritance
to
succeeding
generations
.
It
can
be
clearly
shown
that
the
most
wonderful
instincts
with
which
we
are
acquainted
,
namely
,
those
of
the
hive
bee
and
of
many
ants
,
could
not
possibly
have
been
acquired
by
habit
.
It
will
be
universally
admitted
that
instincts
are
as
important
as
corporeal
structures
for
the
welfare
of
each
species
,
under
its
present
conditions
of
life
.
Under
changed
conditions
of
life
,
it
is
at
least
possible
that
slight
modifications
of
instinct
might
be
profitable
to
a
species
;
and
if
it
can
be
shown
that
instincts
do
vary
ever
so
little
,
then
I
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
preserving
and
continually
accumulating
variations
of
instinct
to
any
extent
that
was
profitable
.
It
is
thus
,
as
I
believe
,
that
all
the
most
complex
and
wonderful
instincts
have
originated
.
As
modifications
of
corporeal
structure
arise
from
,
and
are
increased
by
,
use
or
habit
,
and
are
diminished
or
lost
by
disuse
,
so
I
do
not
doubt
it
has
been
with
instincts
.
But
I
believe
that
the
effects
of
habit
are
in
many
cases
of
subordinate
importance
to
the
effects
of
the
natural
selection
of
what
may
be
called
spontaneous
variations
of
instincts
;
that
is
of
variations
produced
by
the
same
unknown
causes
which
produce
slight
deviations
of
bodily
structure
.
No
complex
instinct
can
possibly
be
produced
through
natural
selection
,
except
by
the
slow
and
gradual
accumulation
of
numerous
slight
,
yet
profitable
,
variations
.
Hence
,
as
in
the
case
of
corporeal
structures
,
we
ought
to
find
in
nature
,
not
the
actual
transitional
gradations
by
which
each
complex
instinct
has
been
acquired
for
these
could
be
found
only
in
the
lineal
ancestors
of
each
species
but
we
ought
to
find
in
the
collateral
lines
of
descent
some
evidence
of
such
gradations
;
or
we
ought
at
least
to
be
able
to
show
that
gradations
of
some
kind
are
possible
;
and
this
we
certainly
can
do
.
I
have
been
surprised
to
find
,
making
allowance
for
the
instincts
of
animals
having
been
but
little
observed
except
in
Europe
and
North
America
,
and
for
no
instinct
being
known
amongst
extinct
species
,
how
very
generally
gradations
,
leading
to
the
most
complex
instincts
,
can
be
discovered
.
Changes
of
instinct
may
sometimes
be
facilitated
by
the
same
species
having
different
instincts
at
different
periods
of
life
,
or
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
,
or
when
placed
under
different
circumstances
,
&c
;
in
which
case
either
the
one
or
the
other
instinct
might
be
preserved
by
natural
selection
.
And
such
instances
of
diversity
of
instinct
in
the
same
species
can
be
shown
to
occur
in
nature
.
Again
,
as
in
the
case
of
corporeal
structure
,
and
conformably
to
my
theory
,
the
instinct
of
each
species
is
good
for
itself
,
but
has
never
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
been
produced
for
the
exclusive
good
of
others
.
One
of
the
strongest
instances
of
an
animal
apparently
performing
an
action
for
the
sole
good
of
another
,
with
which
I
am
acquainted
,
is
that
of
aphides
voluntarily
yielding
,
as
was
first
observed
by
Huber
,
their
sweet
excretion
to
ants
:
that
they
do
so
voluntarily
,
the
following
facts
show
.
I
removed
all
the
ants
from
a
group
of
about
a
dozen
aphides
on
a
dock
plant
,
and
prevented
their
attendance
during
several
hours
.
After
this
interval
,
I
felt
sure
that
the
aphides
would
want
to
excrete
.
I
watched
them
for
some
time
through
a
lens
,
but
not
one
excreted
;
I
then
tickled
and
stroked
them
with
a
hair
in
the
same
manner
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
as
the
ants
do
with
their
antennae
;
but
not
one
excreted
.
Afterwards
I
allowed
an
ant
to
visit
them
,
and
it
immediately
seemed
,
by
its
eager
way
of
running
about
,
to
be
well
aware
what
a
rich
flock
it
had
discovered
;
it
then
began
to
play
with
its
antennae
on
the
abdomen
first
of
one
aphis
and
then
of
another
;
and
each
,
as
soon
as
it
felt
the
antennae
,
immediately
lifted
up
its
abdomen
and
excreted
a
limpid
drop
of
sweet
juice
,
which
was
eagerly
devoured
by
the
ant
.
Even
the
quite
young
aphides
behaved
in
this
manner
,
showing
that
the
action
was
instinctive
,
and
not
the
result
of
experience
.
It
is
certain
,
from
the
observations
of
Huber
,
that
the
aphides
show
no
dislike
to
the
ants
:
if
the
latter
be
not
present
they
are
at
last
compelled
to
eject
their
excretion
.
But
as
the
excretion
is
extremely
viscid
,
it
is
no
doubt
a
convenience
to
the
aphides
to
have
it
removed
;
therefore
probably
they
do
not
excrete
solely
for
the
good
of
the
ants
.
Although
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
animal
performs
an
action
for
the
exclusive
good
of
another
species
,
yet
each
tries
to
take
advantage
of
the
instincts
of
others
,
as
each
takes
advantage
of
the
weaker
bodily
structure
of
other
species
.
So
again
instincts
cannot
be
considered
as
absolutely
perfect
;
but
as
details
on
this
and
other
such
points
are
not
indispensable
,
they
may
be
here
passed
over
.
As
some
degree
of
variation
in
instincts
under
a
state
of
nature
,
and
the
inheritance
of
such
variations
,
are
indispensable
for
the
action
of
natural
selection
,
as
many
instances
as
possible
ought
to
be
given
;
but
want
of
space
prevents
me
.
I
can
only
assert
that
instincts
certainly
do
vary
for
instance
,
the
migratory
instinct
,
both
in
extent
and
direction
,
and
in
its
total
loss
.
So
it
is
with
the
nests
of
birds
,
which
vary
partly
in
dependence
on
the
situations
chosen
,
and
on
the
nature
and
temperature
of
the
country
inhabited
,
but
often
from
causes
wholly
unknown
to
us
:
Audubon
has
given
several
remarkable
cases
of
differences
in
the
nests
of
the
same
species
in
the
northern
and
southern
United
States
.
Why
,
it
has
been
asked
,
if
instinct
be
variable
,
has
it
not
granted
to
the
bee
"
the
ability
to
use
some
other
material
when
wax
was
deficient
"
?
But
what
other
natural
material
could
bees
use
?
They
will
work
,
as
I
have
seen
,
with
wax
hardened
with
vermilion
or
softened
with
lard
.
Andrew
Knight
observed
that
his
bees
,
instead
of
laboriously
collecting
propolis
,
used
a
cement
of
wax
and
turpentine
,
with
which
he
had
covered
decorticated
trees
.
It
has
lately
been
shown
that
bees
,
instead
of
searching
for
pollen
,
will
gladly
use
a
very
different
substance
,
namely
oatmeal
.
Fear
of
any
particular
enemy
is
certainly
an
instinctive
quality
,
as
may
be
seen
in
nestling
birds
,
though
it
is
strengthened
by
experience
,
and
by
the
sight
of
fear
of
the
same
enemy
in
other
animals
.
The
fear
of
man
is
slowly
acquired
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
shown
,
by
the
various
animals
which
inhabit
desert
islands
;
and
we
see
an
instance
of
this
even
in
England
,
in
the
greater
wildness
of
all
our
large
birds
in
comparison
with
our
small
birds
;
for
the
large
birds
have
been
most
persecuted
by
man
.
We
may
safely
attribute
the
greater
wildness
of
our
large
birds
to
this
cause
;
for
in
uninhabited
islands
large
birds
are
not
more
fearful
than
small
;
and
the
magpie
,
so
wary
in
England
,
is
tame
in
Norway
,
as
is
the
hooded
crow
in
Egypt
.
That
the
mental
qualities
of
animals
of
the
same
kind
,
born
in
a
state
of
nature
,
vary
much
,
could
be
shown
by
many
facts
.
Several
cases
could
also
be
adduced
of
occasional
and
strange
habits
in
wild
animals
,
which
,
if
advantageous
to
the
species
,
might
have
given
rise
,
through
natural
selection
,
to
new
instincts
.
But
I
am
well
aware
that
these
general
statements
,
without
the
facts
in
detail
,
will
produce
but
a
feeble
effect
on
the
reader's
mind
.
I
can
only
repeat
my
assurance
,
that
I
do
not
speak
without
good
evidence
.
Inherited
Changes
of
Habit
or
Instinct
in
Domesticated
Animals
The
possibility
,
or
even
probability
,
of
inherited
variations
of
instinct
in
a
state
of
nature
will
be
strengthened
by
briefly
considering
a
few
cases
under
domestication
.
We
shall
thus
be
enabled
to
see
the
part
which
habit
and
the
selection
of
so
called
spontaneous
variations
have
played
in
modifying
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
.
It
is
notorious
how
much
domestic
animals
vary
in
their
mental
qualities
.
With
cats
,
for
instance
,
one
naturally
takes
to
catching
rats
,
and
another
mice
,
and
these
tendencies
are
known
to
be
inherited
.
One
cat
,
according
to
Mr
.
St
.
John
,
always
brought
home
gamebirds
,
another
hares
or
rabbits
,
and
another
hunted
on
marshy
ground
and
almost
nightly
caught
woodcocks
or
snipes
.
A
number
of
curious
and
authentic
instances
could
be
given
of
various
shades
of
disposition
and
of
taste
,
and
likewise
of
the
oddest
tricks
,
associated
with
certain
frames
of
mind
or
periods
of
time
,
being
inherited
.
But
let
us
look
to
the
familiar
case
of
the
breeds
of
the
dogs
:
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
young
pointers
(
I
have
myself
seen
a
striking
instance
)
will
sometimes
point
and
even
back
other
dogs
the
very
first
time
that
they
are
taken
out
;
retrieving
is
certainly
in
some
degree
inherited
by
retrievers
;
and
a
tendency
to
run
round
,
instead
of
at
,
a
flock
of
sheep
,
by
shepherd
dogs
.
I
cannot
see
that
these
actions
,
performed
without
experience
by
the
young
,
and
in
nearly
the
same
manner
by
each
individual
,
performed
with
eager
delight
by
each
breed
,
and
without
the
end
being
known
for
the
young
pointer
can
no
more
know
that
he
points
to
aid
his
master
,
than
the
white
butterfly
knows
why
she
lays
her
eggs
on
the
leaf
of
the
cabbage
I
cannot
see
that
these
actions
differ
essentially
from
true
instincts
.
If
we
were
to
behold
one
kind
of
wolf
,
when
young
and
without
any
training
,
as
soon
as
it
scented
its
prey
,
stand
motionless
like
a
statue
,
and
then
slowly
crawl
forward
with
a
peculiar
gait
;
and
another
kind
of
wolf
rushing
round
,
instead
of
at
,
a
herd
of
deer
,
and
driving
them
to
a
distant
point
,
we
should
assuredly
call
these
actions
instinctive
.
Domestic
instincts
,
as
they
may
be
called
,
are
certainly
far
less
fixed
than
natural
instincts
;
but
they
have
been
acted
on
by
far
less
rigorous
selection
,
and
have
been
transmitted
for
an
incomparably
shorter
period
,
under
less
fixed
conditions
of
life
.
How
strongly
these
domestic
instincts
,
habits
,
and
dispositions
are
inherited
,
and
how
curiously
they
become
mingled
,
is
well
shown
when
different
breeds
of
dogs
are
crossed
.
Thus
it
is
known
that
a
cross
with
a
bull
dog
has
affected
for
many
generations
the
courage
and
obstinacy
of
greyhounds
;
and
a
cross
with
a
greyhound
has
given
to
a
whole
family
of
shepherd
dogs
a
tendency
to
hunt
hares
.
These
domestic
instincts
,
when
thus
tested
by
crossing
,
resemble
natural
instincts
,
which
in
a
like
manner
become
curiously
blended
together
,
and
for
a
long
period
exhibit
traces
of
the
instincts
of
either
parent
:
for
example
,
Le
Roy
describes
a
dog
,
whose
great
grandfather
was
a
wolf
,
and
this
dog
showed
a
trace
of
its
wild
parentage
only
in
one
way
,
by
not
coming
in
a
straight
line
to
his
master
,
when
called
.
Domestic
instincts
are
sometimes
spoken
of
as
actions
which
have
become
inherited
solely
from
long
continued
and
compulsory
habit
,
but
this
is
not
true
.
No
one
would
ever
have
thought
of
teaching
,
or
probably
could
have
taught
,
the
tumbler
pigeon
to
tumble
,
an
action
which
,
as
I
have
witnessed
,
is
performed
by
young
birds
,
that
have
never
seen
a
pigeon
tumble
.
We
may
believe
that
some
one
pigeon
showed
a
slight
tendency
to
this
strange
habit
,
and
that
the
long
continued
selection
of
the
best
individuals
in
successive
generations
made
tumblers
what
they
now
are
;
and
near
Glasgow
there
are
house
tumblers
,
as
I
hear
from
Mr
.
Brent
,
which
cannot
fly
eighteen
inches
high
without
going
head
over
heels
.
It
may
be
doubted
whether
any
one
would
have
thought
of
training
a
dog
to
point
,
had
not
some
one
dog
naturally
shown
a
tendency
in
this
line
;
and
this
is
known
occasionally
to
happen
,
as
I
once
saw
,
in
a
pure
terrier
:
the
act
of
pointing
is
probably
,
as
many
have
thought
,
only
the
exaggerated
pause
of
an
animal
preparing
to
spring
on
its
prey
.
When
the
first
tendency
to
point
was
once
displayed
,
methodical
selection
and
the
inherited
effects
of
compulsory
training
in
each
successive
generation
would
soon
complete
the
work
;
and
unconscious
selection
is
still
in
progress
,
as
each
man
tries
to
procure
,
without
intending
to
improve
the
breed
,
dogs
which
stand
and
hunt
best
.
On
the
other
hand
,
habit
alone
in
some
cases
has
sufficed
;
hardly
any
animal
is
more
difficult
to
tame
than
the
young
of
the
wild
rabbit
;
scarcely
any
animal
is
tamer
than
the
young
of
the
tame
rabbit
;
but
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
domestic
rabbits
have
often
been
selected
for
tameness
alone
;
so
that
we
must
attribute
at
least
the
greater
part
of
the
inherited
change
from
extreme
wildness
to
extreme
tameness
,
to
habit
and
long
continued
close
confinement
.
Natural
instincts
are
lost
under
domestication
:
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
is
seen
in
those
breeds
of
fowls
which
very
rarely
or
never
become
"
broody
,
"
that
is
,
never
wish
to
sit
on
their
eggs
.
Familiarity
alone
prevents
our
seeing
how
largely
and
how
permanently
the
minds
of
our
domestic
animals
have
been
modified
.
It
is
scarcely
possible
to
doubt
that
the
love
of
man
has
become
instinctive
in
the
dog
.
All
wolves
,
foxes
,
jackals
,
and
species
of
the
cat
genus
,
when
kept
tame
,
are
most
eager
to
attack
poultry
,
sheep
,
and
pigs
;
and
this
tendency
has
been
found
incurable
in
dogs
which
have
been
brought
home
as
puppies
from
countries
such
as
Tierra
del
Fuego
and
Australia
,
where
the
savages
do
not
keep
these
domestic
animals
.
How
rarely
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
our
civilised
dogs
,
even
when
quite
young
,
require
to
be
taught
not
to
attack
poultry
,
sheep
,
and
pigs!
No
doubt
they
occasionally
do
make
an
attack
,
and
are
then
beaten
;
and
if
not
cured
,
they
are
destroyed
;
so
that
habit
and
some
degree
of
selection
have
probably
concurred
in
civilising
by
inheritance
our
dogs
.
On
the
other
hand
,
young
chickens
have
lost
,
wholly
by
habit
,
that
fear
of
the
dog
and
cat
which
no
doubt
was
originally
instinctive
with
them
;
for
I
am
informed
by
Captain
Hutton
that
the
young
chickens
of
the
parent
stock
,
the
Gallus
bankiva
,
when
reared
in
India
under
a
hen
,
are
at
first
excessively
wild
.
So
it
is
with
young
pheasants
reared
in
England
under
a
hen
.
It
is
not
that
chickens
have
lost
all
fear
,
but
fear
only
of
dogs
and
cats
,
for
if
the
hen
gives
the
danger
chuckle
,
they
will
run
(
more
especially
young
turkeys
)
from
under
her
,
and
conceal
themselves
in
the
surrounding
grass
or
thickets
;
and
this
is
evidently
done
for
the
instinctive
purpose
of
allowing
as
we
see
in
wild
ground
birds
,
their
mother
to
fly
away
.
But
this
instinct
retained
by
our
chickens
has
become
useless
under
domestication
,
for
the
mother
hen
has
almost
lost
by
disuse
the
power
of
flight
.
Hence
,
we
may
conclude
,
that
under
domestication
instincts
have
been
acquired
,
and
natural
instincts
have
been
lost
,
partly
by
habit
,
and
partly
by
man
selecting
and
accumulating
,
during
successive
generations
,
peculiar
mental
habits
and
actions
,
which
at
first
appeared
from
what
we
must
in
our
ignorance
call
an
accident
.
In
some
cases
compulsory
habit
alone
has
sufficed
to
produce
inherited
mental
changes
;
in
other
cases
,
compulsory
habit
has
done
nothing
,
and
all
has
been
the
result
of
selection
,
pursued
both
methodically
and
unconsciously
:
but
in
most
cases
habit
and
selection
have
probably
concurred
.
Special
Instincts
We
shall
,
perhaps
,
best
understand
how
instincts
in
a
state
of
nature
have
become
modified
by
selection
by
considering
a
few
cases
.
I
will
select
only
three
,
namely
,
the
instinct
which
leads
the
cuckoo
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
;
the
slave
making
instinct
of
certain
ants
;
and
the
cell
making
power
of
the
hive
bee
.
These
two
latter
instincts
have
generally
and
justly
been
ranked
by
naturalists
as
the
most
wonderful
of
all
known
instincts
.
Instincts
of
the
Cuckoo
.
It
is
supposed
by
some
naturalists
that
the
more
immediate
cause
of
the
instinct
of
the
cuckoo
is
,
that
she
lays
her
eggs
,
not
daily
,
but
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
;
so
that
,
if
she
were
to
make
her
own
nest
and
sit
on
her
own
eggs
those
first
laid
would
have
to
be
left
for
some
time
unincubated
,
or
there
would
be
eggs
and
young
birds
of
different
ages
in
the
same
nest
.
If
this
were
the
case
,
the
process
of
laying
and
hatching
might
be
inconveniently
long
,
more
especially
as
she
migrates
at
a
very
early
period
;
and
the
first
hatched
young
would
probably
have
to
be
fed
by
the
male
alone
.
But
the
American
cuckoo
is
in
this
predicament
;
for
she
makes
her
own
nest
,
and
has
eggs
and
young
successively
hatched
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
It
has
been
both
asserted
and
denied
that
the
American
cuckoo
occasionally
lays
her
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
;
but
I
have
lately
heard
from
Dr
.
Merrell
,
of
Iowa
,
that
he
once
found
in
Illinois
a
young
cuckoo
together
with
a
young
jay
in
the
nest
of
a
blue
jay
(
Garrulus
cristatus
)
;
and
as
both
were
nearly
full
feathered
,
there
could
be
no
mistake
in
their
identification
.
I
could
also
give
several
instances
of
various
birds
which
have
been
known
occasionally
to
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
.
Now
let
us
suppose
that
the
ancient
progenitor
of
our
European
cuckoo
had
the
habits
of
the
American
cuckoo
,
and
that
she
occasionally
laid
an
egg
in
another
bird's
nest
.
If
the
old
bird
profited
by
this
occasional
habit
through
being
enabled
to
migrate
earlier
or
through
any
other
cause
;
or
if
the
young
were
made
more
vigorous
by
advantage
being
taken
of
the
mistaken
instinct
of
another
species
than
when
reared
by
their
own
mother
,
encumbered
as
she
could
hardly
fail
to
be
by
having
eggs
and
young
of
different
ages
at
the
same
time
;
then
the
old
birds
or
the
fostered
young
would
gain
an
advantage
.
And
analogy
would
lead
us
to
believe
,
that
the
young
thus
reared
would
be
apt
to
follow
by
inheritance
the
occasional
and
aberrant
habit
of
their
mother
,
and
in
their
turn
would
be
apt
to
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
,
and
thus
be
more
successful
in
rearing
their
young
.
By
a
continued
process
of
this
nature
,
I
believe
that
the
strange
instinct
of
our
cuckoo
has
been
generated
.
It
has
,
also
,
recently
been
ascertained
on
sufficient
evidence
,
by
Adolf
Muller
,
that
the
cuckoo
occasionally
lays
her
eggs
on
the
bare
ground
,
sits
on
them
,
and
feeds
her
young
.
This
rare
event
is
probably
a
case
of
reversion
to
the
long
lost
,
aboriginal
instinct
of
nidification
.
It
has
been
objected
that
I
have
not
noticed
other
related
instincts
and
adaptations
of
structure
in
the
cuckoo
,
which
are
spoken
of
as
necessarily
co
ordinated
.
But
in
all
cases
,
speculation
on
an
instinct
known
to
us
only
in
a
single
species
,
is
useless
,
for
we
have
hitherto
had
no
facts
to
guide
us
.
Until
recently
the
instincts
of
the
European
and
of
the
nonparasitic
American
cuckoo
alone
were
known
.
now
,
owing
to
Mr
.
Ramsay's
observations
,
we
have
learnt
something
about
three
Australian
species
,
which
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds'
nests
.
The
chief
points
to
be
referred
to
are
three
:
first
,
that
the
common
cuckoo
,
with
rare
exceptions
,
lays
only
one
egg
in
a
nest
,
so
that
the
large
and
voracious
young
bird
receives
ample
food
.
Secondly
,
that
the
eggs
are
remarkably
small
,
not
exceeding
those
of
the
skylark
,
a
bird
about
one
fourth
as
large
as
the
cuckoo
.
That
the
small
size
of
the
egg
is
a
real
cause
of
adaptation
we
may
infer
from
the
fact
of
the
non
parasitic
American
cuckoo
laying
full
sized
eggs
.
Thirdly
,
that
the
young
cuckoo
,
soon
after
birth
,
has
the
instinct
,
the
strength
,
and
a
properly
shaped
back
for
ejecting
its
foster
brothers
,
which
then
perish
from
cold
and
hunger
.
This
has
been
boldly
called
a
beneficent
arrangement
,
in
order
that
the
young
cuckoo
may
get
sufficient
food
,
and
that
its
foster
brothers
may
perish
before
they
had
acquired
much
feeling!
Turning
now
to
the
Australian
species
;
though
these
birds
generally
lay
only
one
egg
in
a
nest
,
it
is
not
rare
to
find
two
or
even
three
eggs
in
the
same
nest
.
In
the
bronze
cuckoo
the
eggs
vary
greatly
in
size
,
from
eight
to
ten
times
in
length
.
Now
if
it
had
been
of
an
advantage
to
this
species
to
have
laid
eggs
even
smaller
than
those
now
laid
,
so
as
to
have
deceived
certain
foster
parents
,
or
,
as
is
more
probable
,
to
have
been
hatched
within
a
shorter
period
(
for
it
is
asserted
that
there
is
a
relation
between
the
size
of
eggs
and
the
period
of
their
incubation
)
,
then
there
is
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
a
race
or
species
might
have
been
formed
which
would
have
laid
smaller
and
smaller
eggs
;
for
these
would
have
been
more
safely
hatched
and
reared
.
Mr
.
Ramsay
remarks
that
two
of
the
Australian
cuckoos
,
when
they
lay
their
eggs
in
an
open
nest
,
manifest
a
decided
preference
for
nests
containing
eggs
similar
in
colour
to
their
own
.
The
European
species
apparently
manifests
some
tendency
towards
a
similar
instinct
,
but
not
rarely
departs
from
it
,
as
is
shown
by
her
laying
her
dull
and
pale
coloured
eggs
in
the
nest
of
the
Hedge
warbler
with
bright
greenish
blue
eggs
.
Had
our
cuckoo
invariably
displayed
the
above
instinct
,
it
would
assuredly
have
been
added
to
those
which
it
is
assumed
must
all
have
been
acquired
together
.
The
eggs
of
the
Australian
bronze
cuckoo
vary
,
according
to
Mr
.
Ramsay
,
to
an
extraordinary
degree
in
colour
;
so
that
in
this
respect
,
as
well
as
in
size
,
natural
selection
might
have
secured
and
fixed
any
advantageous
variation
.
In
the
case
of
the
European
cuckoo
,
the
offspring
of
the
foster
parents
are
commonly
ejected
from
the
nest
within
three
days
after
the
cuckoo
is
hatched
;
and
as
the
latter
at
this
age
is
in
a
most
helpless
condition
,
Mr
.
Gould
was
formerly
inclined
to
believe
that
the
act
of
ejection
was
performed
by
the
foster
parents
themselves
.
But
he
has
now
received
a
trustworthy
account
of
a
young
cuckoo
which
was
actually
seen
,
whilst
still
blind
and
not
able
even
to
hold
up
its
own
head
,
in
the
act
of
ejecting
its
foster
brothers
.
One
of
these
was
replaced
in
the
nest
by
the
observer
,
and
was
again
thrown
out
.
With
respect
to
the
means
by
which
this
strange
and
odious
instinct
was
acquired
,
if
it
were
of
great
importance
for
the
young
cuckoo
,
as
is
probably
the
case
,
to
receive
as
much
food
as
possible
soon
after
birth
,
I
can
see
no
special
difficulty
in
its
having
gradually
acquired
,
during
successive
generations
,
the
blind
desire
,
the
strength
,
and
structure
necessary
for
the
work
of
ejection
;
for
those
young
cuckoos
which
had
such
habits
and
structure
best
developed
would
be
the
most
securely
reared
.
The
first
step
towards
the
acquisition
of
the
proper
instinct
might
have
been
more
unintentional
restlessness
on
the
part
of
the
young
bird
,
when
somewhat
advanced
in
age
and
strength
;
the
habit
having
been
afterwards
improved
,
and
transmitted
to
an
earlier
age
.
I
can
see
no
more
difficulty
in
this
,
than
in
the
unhatched
young
of
other
birds
acquiring
the
instinct
to
break
through
their
own
shells
;
or
than
in
young
snakes
acquiring
in
their
upper
jaws
,
as
Owen
has
remarked
,
a
transitory
sharp
tooth
for
cutting
through
the
tough
egg
shell
.
For
if
each
part
is
liable
to
individual
variations
at
all
ages
,
and
the
variations
tend
to
be
inherited
at
a
corresponding
or
earlier
age
,
propositions
which
cannot
be
disputed
,
then
the
instincts
and
structure
of
the
young
could
be
slowly
modified
as
surely
as
those
of
the
adult
;
and
both
cases
must
stand
or
fall
together
with
the
whole
theory
of
natural
selection
.
Some
species
of
Molothrus
,
a
widely
distinct
genus
of
American
birds
,
allied
to
our
starlings
,
have
parasitic
habits
like
those
of
the
cuckoo
;
and
the
species
present
an
interesting
gradation
in
the
perfection
of
their
instincts
.
The
sexes
of
Molothrus
badius
are
stated
by
an
excellent
observer
,
Mr
.
Hudson
,
sometimes
to
live
promiscuously
together
in
flocks
,
and
sometimes
to
pair
.
They
either
build
a
nest
of
their
own
,
or
seize
on
one
belonging
to
some
other
bird
,
occasionally
throwing
out
the
nestlings
of
the
stranger
.
They
either
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nest
thus
appropriated
,
or
oddly
enough
build
one
for
themselves
on
the
top
of
it
.
They
usually
sit
on
their
own
eggs
and
rear
their
own
young
;
but
Mr
.
Hudson
says
it
is
probable
that
they
are
occasionally
parasitic
,
for
he
has
seen
the
young
of
this
species
following
old
birds
of
a
distinct
kind
and
clamouring
to
be
fed
by
them
.
The
parasitic
habits
of
another
species
of
Molothrus
,
the
M
.
bonariensis
,
are
much
more
highly
developed
than
those
of
the
last
,
but
are
still
far
from
perfect
.
This
bird
,
as
far
as
it
is
known
,
invariably
lays
its
eggs
in
the
nests
of
strangers
;
but
it
is
remarkable
that
several
together
sometimes
commence
to
build
an
irregular
untidy
nest
of
their
own
,
placed
in
singularly
ill
adapted
situations
,
as
on
the
leaves
of
a
large
thistle
.
They
never
,
however
,
as
far
as
Mr
.
Hudson
has
ascertained
,
complete
a
nest
for
themselves
.
They
often
lay
so
many
eggs
from
fifteen
to
twenty
in
the
same
foster
nest
,
that
few
or
none
can
possibly
be
hatched
.
They
have
,
moreover
,
the
extraordinary
habit
of
pecking
holes
in
the
eggs
,
whether
of
their
own
species
or
of
their
foster
parents
,
which
they
find
in
the
appropriated
nests
.
They
drop
also
many
eggs
on
the
bare
ground
,
which
are
thus
wasted
.
A
third
species
,
the
M
.
pecoris
of
North
America
,
has
acquired
instincts
as
perfect
as
those
of
the
cuckoo
,
for
it
never
lays
more
than
one
egg
in
a
foster
nest
,
so
that
the
young
bird
is
securely
reared
.
Mr
.
Hudson
is
a
strong
disbeliever
in
evolution
,
but
he
appears
to
have
been
so
much
struck
by
the
imperfect
instincts
of
the
Molothrus
bonariensis
that
he
quotes
my
words
,
and
asks
,
"
Must
we
consider
these
habits
,
not
as
especially
endowed
or
created
instincts
,
but
as
small
consequences
of
one
general
law
,
namely
,
transition
?
"
Various
birds
,
as
has
already
been
remarked
,
occasionally
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nest
of
other
birds
.
This
habit
is
not
very
uncommon
with
the
Gallinaceae
,
and
throws
some
light
on
the
singular
instinct
of
the
ostrich
.
In
this
family
several
hen
birds
unite
and
lay
first
a
few
eggs
in
one
nest
and
then
in
another
;
and
these
are
hatched
by
the
males
.
This
instinct
may
probably
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
of
the
hens
laying
a
large
number
of
eggs
,
but
,
as
with
the
cuckoo
,
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
.
The
instinct
,
however
,
of
the
American
ostrich
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
Molothrus
bonariensis
,
has
not
as
yet
been
perfected
;
for
a
surprising
number
of
eggs
lie
strewed
over
the
plains
,
so
that
in
one
day's
hunting
I
picked
up
no
less
than
twenty
lost
and
wasted
eggs
.
Many
bees
are
parasitic
,
and
regularly
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nests
of
other
kinds
of
bees
.
This
case
is
more
remarkable
than
that
of
the
cuckoo
;
for
these
bees
have
not
only
had
their
instincts
but
their
structure
modified
in
accordance
with
their
parasitic
habits
;
for
they
do
not
possess
the
pollen
collecting
apparatus
which
would
have
been
indispensable
if
they
had
stored
up
food
for
their
own
young
.
Some
species
of
Sphegidea
(
wasp
like
insects
)
are
likewise
parasitic
;
and
M
.
Fabre
has
lately
shown
good
reason
for
believing
that
,
although
the
Tachytes
nigra
generally
makes
its
own
burrow
and
stores
it
with
paralysed
prey
for
its
own
larvae
,
yet
that
,
when
this
insect
finds
a
burrow
already
made
and
stored
by
another
species
,
it
takes
advantage
of
the
prize
and
becomes
for
the
occasion
parasitic
.
In
this
case
,
as
with
that
of
the
Molothrus
or
cuckoo
,
I
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
making
an
occasional
habit
permanent
,
if
of
advantage
to
the
species
,
and
if
the
insect
whose
nest
and
stored
food
are
feloniously
appropriated
,
be
not
thus
exterminated
.
Slave
making
instinct
.
This
remarkable
instinct
was
first
discovered
in
the
Formica
(
Polyerges
)
rufescens
by
Pierre
Huber
,
a
better
observer
even
than
his
celebrated
father
.
This
ant
is
absolutely
dependent
on
its
slaves
;
without
their
aid
,
the
species
would
certainly
become
extinct
in
a
single
year
.
The
males
and
fertile
female
do
no
work
of
any
kind
,
and
the
workers
or
sterile
females
,
though
most
energetic
and
courageous
in
capturing
slaves
,
do
no
other
work
.
They
are
incapable
of
making
their
own
nests
,
or
of
feeding
their
own
larvae
.
When
the
old
nest
is
found
inconvenient
,
and
they
have
to
migrate
,
it
is
the
slaves
which
determine
the
migration
,
and
actually
carry
their
masters
in
their
jaws
.
So
utterly
helpless
are
the
masters
,
that
when
Huber
shut
up
thirty
of
them
without
a
slave
,
but
with
plenty
of
the
food
which
they
like
best
,
and
with
their
own
larvae
and
pupae
to
stimulate
them
to
work
,
they
did
nothing
;
they
could
not
even
feed
themselves
,
and
many
perished
of
hunger
.
Huber
then
introduced
a
single
slave
(
F
.
fusca
)
,
and
she
instantly
set
to
work
,
fed
and
saved
the
survivors
;
made
some
cells
and
tended
the
larvae
,
and
put
all
to
rights
.
What
can
be
more
extraordinary
than
these
well
ascertained
facts
?
If
we
had
not
known
of
any
other
slave
making
ant
,
it
would
have
been
hopeless
to
speculate
how
so
wonderful
an
instinct
could
have
been
perfected
.
Another
species
,
Formica
sanguinea
,
was
likewise
first
discovered
by
P
.
Huber
to
be
a
slave
making
ant
.
This
species
is
found
in
the
southern
parts
of
England
,
and
its
habits
have
been
attended
to
by
Mr
.
F
.
Smith
,
of
the
British
Museum
,
to
whom
I
am
much
indebted
for
information
on
this
and
other
subjects
.
Although
fully
trusting
to
the
statements
of
Huber
and
Mr
.
Smith
,
I
tried
to
approach
the
subject
in
a
sceptical
frame
of
mind
,
as
any
one
may
well
be
excused
for
doubting
the
existence
of
so
extraordinary
an
instinct
as
that
of
making
slaves
.
Hence
,
I
will
give
the
observations
which
I
made
in
some
little
detail
.
I
opened
fourteen
nests
of
F
.
sanguinea
,
and
found
a
few
slaves
in
all
.
Males
and
fertile
females
of
the
slave
species
(
F
.
fusca
)
are
found
only
in
their
own
proper
communities
,
and
have
never
been
observed
in
the
nests
of
F
.
sanguinea
.
The
slaves
are
black
and
not
above
half
the
size
of
their
red
masters
,
so
that
the
contrast
in
their
appearance
is
great
.
When
the
nest
is
slightly
disturbed
,
the
slaves
occasionally
come
out
,
and
like
their
masters
are
much
agitated
and
defend
the
nest
:
when
the
nest
is
much
disturbed
,
and
the
larvae
and
pupae
are
exposed
,
the
slaves
work
energetically
together
with
their
masters
in
carrying
them
away
to
a
place
of
safety
.
Hence
,
it
is
clear
,
that
the
slaves
feel
quite
at
home
.
During
the
months
of
June
and
July
,
on
three
successive
years
,
I
watched
for
many
hours
several
nests
in
Surrey
and
Sussex
,
and
never
saw
a
slave
either
leave
or
enter
a
nest
.
As
,
during
these
months
,
the
slaves
are
very
few
in
number
,
I
thought
that
they
might
behave
differently
when
more
numerous
;
but
Mr
.
Smith
informs
me
that
he
has
watched
the
nests
at
various
hours
during
May
,
June
,
and
August
,
both
in
Surrey
and
Hampshire
,
and
has
never
seen
the
slaves
,
though
present
in
large
numbers
in
August
,
either
leave
or
enter
the
nest
.
Hence
he
considers
them
as
strictly
household
slaves
.
The
masters
,
on
the
other
hand
,
may
be
constantly
seen
bringing
in
materials
for
the
nest
,
and
food
of
all
kinds
.
During
the
year
1860
,
however
,
in
the
month
of
July
,
I
came
across
a
community
with
an
unusually
large
stock
of
slaves
,
and
I
observed
a
few
slaves
mingled
with
their
masters
leaving
the
nest
,
and
marching
along
the
same
road
to
a
tall
Scotch
fir
tree
,
twenty
five
yards
distant
,
which
they
ascended
together
,
probably
in
search
of
aphides
or
cocci
.
According
to
Huber
,
who
had
ample
opportunities
for
observation
,
the
slaves
in
Switzerland
habitually
work
with
their
masters
in
making
the
nest
,
and
they
alone
open
and
close
the
doors
in
the
morning
and
evening
;
and
,
as
Huber
expressly
states
,
their
principal
office
is
to
search
for
aphides
.
This
difference
in
the
usual
habits
of
the
masters
and
slaves
in
the
two
countries
,
probably
depends
merely
on
the
slaves
being
captured
in
greater
numbers
in
Switzerland
than
in
England
.
One
day
I
fortunately
witnessed
a
migration
of
F
.
sanguinea
from
one
nest
to
another
,
and
it
was
a
most
interesting
spectacle
to
behold
the
masters
carefully
carrying
their
slaves
in
their
jaws
instead
of
being
carried
by
them
,
as
in
the
case
of
F
.
rufescens
.
Another
day
my
attention
was
struck
by
about
a
score
of
the
slave
makers
haunting
the
same
spot
,
and
evidently
not
in
search
of
food
;
they
approached
and
were
vigorously
repulsed
by
an
independent
community
of
the
slave
species
(
F
.
fusca
)
;
sometimes
as
many
as
three
of
these
ants
clinging
to
the
legs
of
the
slavemaking
F
.
sanguinea
.
The
latter
ruthlessly
killed
their
small
opponents
,
and
carried
their
dead
bodies
as
food
to
their
nest
,
twenty
nine
yards
distant
;
but
they
were
prevented
from
getting
any
pupae
to
rear
as
slaves
.
I
then
dug
up
a
small
parcel
of
the
pupae
of
F
.
fusca
from
another
nest
,
and
put
them
down
on
a
bare
spot
near
the
place
of
combat
;
they
were
eagerly
seized
and
carried
off
by
the
tyrants
,
who
perhaps
fancied
that
,
after
all
,
they
had
been
victorious
in
their
late
combat
.
At
the
same
time
I
laid
on
the
same
place
a
small
parcel
of
the
pupae
of
another
species
,
F
.
flava
,
with
a
few
of
these
little
yellow
ants
still
clinging
to
the
fragments
of
their
nest
.
This
species
is
sometimes
,
though
rarely
,
made
into
slaves
,
as
has
been
described
by
Mr
.
Smith
.
Although
so
small
a
species
,
it
is
very
courageous
,
and
I
have
seen
it
ferociously
attack
other
ants
.
In
one
instance
I
found
to
my
surprise
an
independent
community
of
F
.
flava
under
a
stone
beneath
a
nest
of
the
slavemaking
F
.
sanguinea
;
and
when
I
had
accidentally
disturbed
both
nests
,
the
little
ants
attacked
their
big
neighbours
with
surprising
courage
.
Now
I
was
curious
to
ascertain
whether
F
.
sanguinea
could
distinguish
the
pupae
of
F
.
fusca
,
which
they
habitually
make
into
slaves
,
from
those
of
the
little
and
furious
F
.
flava
,
which
they
rarely
capture
,
and
it
was
evident
that
they
did
at
once
distinguish
them
;
for
we
have
seen
that
they
eagerly
and
instantly
seized
the
pupae
of
F
.
fusca
,
whereas
they
were
much
terrified
when
they
came
across
the
pupae
or
even
the
earth
from
the
nest
,
of
F
.
flava
,
and
quickly
ran
away
;
but
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
shortly
after
all
the
little
yellow
ants
had
crawled
away
,
they
took
heart
and
carried
off
the
pupae
.
One
evening
I
visited
another
community
of
F
.
sanguinea
,
and
found
a
number
of
these
ants
returning
home
and
entering
their
nests
,
carrying
the
dead
bodies
of
F
.
fusca
(
showing
that
it
was
not
a
migration
)
and
numerous
pupae
.
I
traced
a
long
file
of
ants
burthened
with
booty
,
for
about
forty
yards
back
,
to
a
very
thick
clump
of
heath
,
whence
I
saw
the
last
individual
of
F
.
sanguinea
emerge
,
carrying
a
pupa
;
but
I
was
not
able
to
find
the
desolated
nest
in
the
thick
heath
.
The
nest
,
however
,
must
have
been
close
at
hand
,
for
two
or
three
individuals
of
F
.
fusca
were
rushing
about
in
the
greatest
agitation
,
and
one
was
perched
motionless
with
its
own
pupa
in
its
mouth
on
the
top
of
a
spray
of
heath
,
an
image
of
despair
over
its
ravaged
home
.
Such
are
the
facts
,
though
they
did
not
need
confirmation
by
me
,
in
regard
to
the
wonderful
instinct
of
making
slaves
.
Let
it
be
observed
what
a
contrast
the
instinctive
habits
of
F
.
sanguinea
present
with
those
of
the
continental
F
.
rufescens
.
The
latter
does
not
build
its
own
nest
,
does
not
determine
its
own
migrations
,
does
not
collect
food
for
itself
or
its
young
,
and
cannot
even
feed
itself
:
it
is
absolutely
dependent
on
its
numerous
slaves
.
Formica
sanguinea
,
on
the
other
hand
,
possesses
much
fewer
slaves
,
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
summer
extremely
few
:
the
masters
determine
when
and
where
a
new
nest
shall
be
formed
,
and
when
they
migrate
,
the
masters
carry
the
slaves
.
Both
in
Switzerland
and
England
the
slaves
seem
to
have
the
exclusive
care
of
the
larvae
,
and
the
masters
alone
go
on
slave
making
expeditions
.
In
Switzerland
the
slaves
and
masters
work
together
,
making
and
bringing
materials
for
the
nest
both
,
but
chiefly
the
slaves
,
tend
,
and
milk
,
as
it
may
be
called
,
their
aphides
;
and
thus
both
collect
food
for
the
community
.
In
England
the
masters
alone
usually
leave
the
nest
to
collect
building
materials
and
food
for
themselves
,
their
slaves
and
larvae
.
So
that
the
masters
in
this
country
receive
much
less
service
from
their
slaves
than
they
do
in
Switzerland
.
By
what
steps
the
instinct
of
F
.
sanguinea
originated
I
will
not
pretend
to
conjecture
.
But
as
ants
which
are
not
slave
makers
will
,
as
I
have
seen
,
carry
off
the
pupae
of
other
species
,
if
scattered
near
their
nests
,
it
is
possible
that
such
pupae
originally
stored
as
food
might
become
developed
;
and
the
foreign
ants
thus
unintentionally
reared
would
then
follow
their
proper
instincts
,
and
do
what
work
they
could
.
If
their
presence
proved
useful
to
the
species
which
had
seized
them
if
it
were
more
advantageous
to
this
species
to
capture
workers
than
to
procreate
them
the
habit
of
collecting
pupae
,
originally
for
food
,
might
by
natural
selection
be
strengthened
and
rendered
permanent
for
the
very
different
purpose
of
raising
slaves
.
When
the
instinct
was
once
acquired
,
if
carried
out
to
a
much
less
extent
even
than
in
our
British
F
.
sanguinea
,
which
,
as
we
have
seen
,
is
less
aided
by
its
slaves
than
the
same
species
in
Switzerland
,
natural
selection
might
increase
and
modify
the
instinct
always
supposing
each
modification
to
be
of
use
to
the
species
until
an
ant
was
formed
as
abjectly
dependent
on
its
slaves
as
is
the
Formica
rufescens
.
Cell
making
instinct
of
the
Hive
Bee
.
I
will
not
here
enter
on
minute
details
on
this
subject
,
but
will
merely
give
an
outline
of
the
conclusions
at
which
I
have
arrived
.
He
must
be
a
dull
man
who
can
examine
the
exquisite
structure
of
a
comb
,
so
beautifully
adapted
to
its
end
,
without
enthusiastic
admiration
.
We
hear
from
mathematicians
that
bees
have
practically
solved
a
recondite
problem
,
and
have
made
their
cells
of
the
proper
shape
to
hold
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
honey
,
with
the
least
possible
consumption
of
precious
wax
in
their
construction
.
It
has
been
remarked
that
a
skilful
workman
with
fitting
tools
and
measures
,
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
cells
of
wax
of
the
true
form
,
though
this
is
effected
by
a
crowd
of
bees
working
in
a
dark
hive
.
Granting
whatever
instincts
you
please
,
it
seems
at
first
quite
inconceivable
how
they
can
make
all
the
necessary
angles
and
planes
,
or
even
perceive
when
they
are
correctly
made
.
But
the
difficulty
is
not
nearly
so
great
as
it
at
first
appears
:
all
this
beautiful
work
can
be
shown
,
I
think
,
to
follow
from
a
few
simple
instincts
.
I
was
led
to
investigate
this
subject
by
Mr
.
Waterhouse
,
who
has
shown
that
the
form
of
the
cell
stands
in
close
relation
to
the
presence
of
adjoining
cells
;
and
the
following
view
may
,
perhaps
,
be
considered
only
as
a
modification
of
this
theory
.
Let
us
look
to
the
great
principle
of
gradation
,
and
see
whether
Nature
does
not
reveal
to
us
her
method
of
work
.
At
one
end
of
a
short
series
we
have
humble
bees
,
which
use
their
old
cocoons
to
hold
honey
,
sometimes
adding
to
them
short
tubes
of
wax
,
and
likewise
making
separate
and
very
irregular
rounded
cells
of
wax
.
At
the
other
end
of
the
series
we
have
the
cells
of
the
hive
bee
,
placed
in
a
double
layer
:
each
cell
,
as
is
well
known
,
is
an
hexagonal
prism
,
with
the
basal
edges
of
its
six
sides
bevelled
so
as
to
join
an
inverted
pyramid
,
of
three
rhombs
.
These
rhombs
have
certain
angles
,
and
the
three
which
form
the
pyramidal
base
of
a
single
cell
on
one
side
of
the
comb
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
bases
of
three
adjoining
cells
on
the
opposite
side
.
In
the
series
between
the
extreme
perfection
of
the
cells
of
the
hive
bee
and
the
simplicity
of
those
of
the
humble
bee
we
have
the
cells
of
the
Mexican
Melipona
domestica
,
carefully
described
and
figured
by
Pierre
Huber
.
The
Melipona
itself
is
intermediate
in
structure
between
the
hive
and
humble
bee
,
but
more
nearly
related
to
the
latter
;
it
forms
a
nearly
regular
waxen
comb
of
cylindrical
cells
,
in
which
the
young
are
hatched
,
and
,
in
addition
,
some
large
cells
of
wax
for
holding
honey
.
These
latter
cells
are
nearly
spherical
and
of
nearly
equal
sizes
,
and
are
aggregated
into
an
irregular
mass
.
But
the
important
point
to
notice
is
,
that
these
cells
are
always
made
at
that
degree
of
nearness
to
each
other
that
they
would
have
intersected
or
broken
into
each
other
if
the
spheres
had
been
completed
;
but
this
is
never
permitted
,
the
bees
building
perfectly
flat
walls
of
wax
between
the
spheres
which
thus
tend
to
intersect
.
Hence
,
each
cell
consists
of
an
outer
spherical
portion
,
and
of
two
,
three
,
or
more
flat
surfaces
,
according
as
the
cell
adjoins
two
,
three
,
or
more
other
cells
.
When
one
cell
rests
on
three
other
cells
,
which
,
from
the
spheres
being
nearly
of
the
same
size
,
is
very
frequently
and
necessarily
the
case
,
the
three
flat
surfaces
are
united
into
a
pyramid
;
and
this
pyramid
,
as
Huber
has
remarked
,
is
manifestly
a
gross
imitation
of
the
three
sided
pyramidal
base
of
the
cell
of
the
hive
bee
.
As
in
the
cells
of
the
hive
bee
,
so
here
,
the
three
plane
surfaces
in
any
one
cell
necessarily
enter
into
the
construction
of
three
adjoining
cells
.
It
is
obvious
that
the
Melipona
saves
wax
,
and
what
is
more
important
,
labour
,
by
this
manner
of
building
;
for
the
flat
walls
between
the
adjoining
cells
are
not
double
,
but
are
of
the
same
thickness
as
the
outer
spherical
portions
,
and
yet
each
flat
portion
forms
a
part
of
two
cells
.
Reflecting
on
this
case
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
the
Melipona
had
made
its
spheres
at
some
given
distance
from
each
other
,
and
had
made
them
of
equal
sizes
and
had
arranged
them
symmetrically
in
a
double
layer
,
the
resulting
structure
would
have
been
as
perfect
as
the
comb
of
the
hive
bee
.
Accordingly
I
wrote
to
Professor
Miller
of
Cambridge
,
and
this
geometer
has
kindly
read
over
the
following
statement
,
drawn
up
from
his
information
,
and
tells
me
that
it
is
strictly
correct
:
If
a
number
of
equal
squares
be
described
with
their
centres
placed
in
two
parallel
layers
;
with
the
centre
of
each
sphere
at
the
distance
of
radius
X
the
square
root
of
2
,
or
radius
X
1
.
41421
(
or
at
some
lesser
distance
)
,
from
the
centres
of
the
six
surrounding
spheres
in
the
same
layer
;
and
at
the
same
distance
from
the
centres
of
the
adjoining
spheres
in
the
other
and
parallel
layer
;
then
,
if
planes
of
intersection
between
the
several
spheres
in
both
layers
be
formed
,
there
will
result
a
double
layer
of
hexagonal
prisms
united
together
by
pyramidal
bases
formed
of
three
rhombs
;
and
the
rhombs
and
the
sides
of
the
hexagonal
prisms
will
have
every
angle
identically
the
same
with
the
best
measurements
which
have
been
made
of
the
cells
of
the
hive
bee
.
But
I
hear
from
Prof
.
Wyman
,
who
has
made
numerous
careful
measurements
,
that
the
accuracy
of
the
workmanship
of
the
bee
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
;
so
much
so
,
that
whatever
the
typical
form
of
the
cell
may
be
,
it
is
rarely
,
if
ever
,
realised
.
Hence
we
may
safely
conclude
that
,
if
we
could
slightly
modify
the
instincts
already
possessed
by
the
Melipona
,
and
in
themselves
not
very
wonderful
,
this
bee
would
make
a
structure
as
wonderfully
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive
bee
.
We
must
suppose
that
Melipona
to
have
the
power
of
forming
her
cells
truly
spherical
,
and
of
equal
sizes
,
and
this
would
not
be
very
surprising
,
seeing
that
she
already
does
so
to
a
certain
extent
,
and
seeing
what
perfectly
cylindrical
burrows
many
insects
make
in
wood
,
apparently
by
turning
round
on
a
fixed
point
.
We
must
suppose
the
Melipona
to
arrange
her
cells
in
level
layers
,
as
she
already
does
her
cylindrical
cells
;
and
we
must
further
suppose
,
and
this
is
the
greatest
difficulty
,
that
she
can
somehow
judge
accurately
at
what
distance
to
stand
from
her
fellow
labourers
when
several
are
making
their
spheres
;
but
she
is
already
so
far
enabled
to
judge
of
distance
,
that
she
always
describes
her
spheres
so
as
to
intersect
to
a
certain
extent
;
and
then
she
unites
the
points
of
intersection
by
perfectly
flat
surfaces
.
By
such
modifications
of
instincts
which
in
themselves
are
not
very
wonderful
,
hardly
more
wonderful
than
those
which
guide
a
bird
to
make
its
nest
,
I
believe
that
the
hive
bee
has
acquired
,
through
natural
selection
,
her
inimitable
architectural
powers
.
But
this
theory
can
be
tested
by
experiment
.
Following
the
example
of
Mr
.
Tegetmeier
,
I
separated
two
combs
,
and
put
between
them
a
long
,
thick
,
rectangular
strip
of
wax
:
the
bees
instantly
began
to
excavate
minute
circular
pits
in
it
;
and
as
they
deepened
these
little
pits
,
they
made
them
wider
and
wider
until
they
were
converted
into
shallow
basins
,
appearing
to
the
eye
perfectly
true
or
parts
of
a
sphere
,
and
of
about
the
diameter
of
a
cell
.
It
was
most
interesting
to
observe
that
,
wherever
several
bees
had
begun
to
excavate
these
basins
near
together
,
they
had
begun
their
work
at
such
a
distance
from
each
other
,
that
by
the
time
the
basins
had
acquired
the
above
stated
width
(
i
.
e
.
about
the
width
of
an
ordinary
cell
)
,
and
were
in
depth
about
one
sixth
of
the
diameter
of
the
sphere
of
which
they
formed
a
part
,
the
rims
of
the
basins
intersected
or
broke
into
each
other
.
As
soon
as
this
occurred
,
the
bees
ceased
to
excavate
,
and
began
to
build
up
flat
walls
of
wax
on
the
lines
of
intersection
between
the
basins
,
so
that
each
hexagonal
prism
was
built
upon
the
scalloped
edge
of
a
smooth
basin
,
instead
of
on
the
straight
edges
of
a
three
sided
pyramid
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
cells
.
I
then
put
into
the
hive
,
instead
of
a
thick
,
rectangular
piece
of
wax
,
a
thin
and
narrow
,
knife
edged
ridge
,
coloured
with
vermilion
.
The
bees
instantly
began
on
both
sides
to
excavate
little
basins
near
to
each
other
,
in
the
same
way
as
before
;
but
the
ridge
of
wax
was
so
thin
,
that
the
bottoms
of
the
basins
,
if
they
had
been
excavated
to
the
same
depth
as
in
the
former
experiment
,
would
have
broken
into
each
other
from
the
opposite
sides
.
The
bees
,
however
,
did
not
suffer
this
to
happen
,
and
they
stopped
their
excavations
in
due
time
;
so
that
the
basins
,
as
soon
as
they
had
been
a
little
deepened
,
came
to
have
flat
bases
;
and
these
flat
bases
,
formed
by
thin
little
plates
of
the
vermilion
wax
left
ungnawed
,
were
situated
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
judge
,
exactly
along
the
planes
of
imaginary
intersection
between
the
basins
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
ridge
of
wax
.
In
some
parts
,
only
small
portions
,
in
other
parts
,
large
portions
of
a
rhombic
plate
were
thus
left
between
the
opposed
basins
,
but
the
work
,
from
the
unnatural
state
of
things
,
had
not
been
neatly
performed
.
The
bees
must
have
worked
at
very
nearly
the
same
rate
in
circularly
gnawing
away
and
deepening
the
basins
on
both
sides
of
the
ridge
of
vermilion
wax
,
in
order
to
have
thus
succeeded
in
leaving
flat
plates
between
the
basins
,
by
stopping
work
at
the
planes
of
intersection
.
Considering
how
flexible
thin
wax
is
,
I
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
difficulty
in
the
bees
,
whilst
at
work
on
the
two
sides
of
a
strip
of
wax
,
perceiving
when
they
have
gnawed
the
wax
away
to
the
proper
thinness
,
and
then
stopping
their
work
.
In
ordinary
combs
it
has
appeared
to
me
that
the
bees
do
not
always
succeed
in
working
at
exactly
the
same
rate
from
the
opposite
sides
;
for
I
have
noticed
half
completed
rhombs
at
the
base
of
a
just
commenced
cell
,
which
were
slightly
concave
on
one
side
,
where
I
suppose
that
the
bees
had
excavated
too
quickly
,
and
convex
on
the
opposed
side
where
the
bees
had
worked
less
quickly
.
In
one
well
marked
instance
,
I
put
the
comb
back
into
the
hive
,
and
allowed
the
bees
to
go
on
working
for
a
short
time
,
and
again
examined
the
cell
,
and
I
found
that
the
rhombic
plate
had
been
completed
,
and
had
become
perfectly
flat
:
it
was
absolutely
impossible
,
from
the
extreme
thinness
of
the
little
plate
,
that
they
could
have
effected
this
by
gnawing
away
the
convex
side
;
and
I
suspect
that
the
bees
in
such
cases
stand
on
opposite
sides
and
push
and
bend
the
ductile
and
warm
wax
(
which
as
I
have
tried
is
easily
done
)
into
its
proper
intermediate
plane
,
and
thus
flatten
it
.
From
the
experiment
of
the
ridge
of
vermilion
wax
we
can
see
that
,
if
the
bees
were
to
build
for
themselves
a
thin
wall
of
wax
,
they
could
make
their
cells
of
the
proper
shape
,
by
standing
at
the
proper
distance
from
each
other
,
by
excavating
at
the
same
rate
,
and
by
endeavouring
to
make
equal
spherical
hollows
,
but
never
allowing
the
spheres
to
break
into
each
other
.
Now
bees
,
as
may
be
clearly
seen
by
examining
the
edge
of
a
growing
comb
,
do
make
a
rough
,
circumferential
wall
or
rim
all
round
the
comb
;
and
they
gnaw
this
away
from
the
opposite
sides
,
always
working
circularly
as
they
deepen
each
cell
.
They
do
not
make
the
whole
three
sided
pyramidal
base
of
any
one
cell
at
the
same
time
,
but
only
that
one
rhombic
plate
which
stands
on
the
extreme
growing
margin
,
or
the
two
plates
,
as
the
case
may
be
;
and
they
never
complete
the
upper
edges
of
the
rhombic
plates
,
until
the
hexagonal
walls
are
commenced
.
Some
of
these
statements
differ
from
those
made
by
the
justly
celebrated
elder
Huber
,
but
I
am
convinced
of
their
accuracy
;
and
if
I
had
space
,
I
would
show
that
they
are
conformable
with
my
theory
.
Huber's
statement
that
the
very
first
cell
is
excavated
out
of
a
little
parallel
sided
wall
of
wax
,
is
not
,
as
far
as
I
have
seen
,
strictly
correct
;
the
first
commencement
having
always
been
a
little
hood
of
wax
;
but
I
will
not
here
enter
on
details
.
We
see
how
important
a
part
excavation
plays
in
the
construction
of
the
cells
;
but
it
would
be
a
great
error
to
suppose
that
the
bees
cannot
build
up
a
rough
wall
of
wax
in
the
proper
position
that
is
,
along
the
plane
of
intersection
between
two
adjoining
spheres
.
I
have
several
specimens
showing
clearly
that
they
can
do
this
.
Even
in
the
rude
circumferential
rim
or
wall
of
wax
round
a
growing
comb
,
flexures
may
sometimes
be
observed
,
corresponding
in
position
to
the
planes
of
the
rhombic
basal
plates
of
future
cells
.
But
the
rough
wall
of
wax
has
in
every
case
to
be
finished
off
,
by
being
largely
gnawed
away
on
both
sides
.
The
manner
in
which
the
bees
build
is
curious
;
they
always
make
the
first
rough
wall
from
ten
to
twenty
times
thicker
than
the
excessively
thin
finished
wall
of
the
cell
,
which
will
ultimately
be
left
.
We
shall
understand
how
they
work
,
by
supposing
masons
first
to
pile
up
a
broad
ridge
of
cement
,
and
then
to
begin
cutting
it
away
equally
on
both
sides
near
the
ground
,
till
a
smooth
,
very
thin
wall
is
left
in
the
middle
;
the
masons
always
piling
up
the
cut
away
cement
,
and
adding
fresh
cement
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
.
We
shall
thus
have
a
thin
wall
steadily
growing
upward
but
always
crowned
by
a
gigantic
coping
.
From
all
the
cells
,
both
those
just
commenced
and
those
completed
,
being
thus
crowned
by
a
strong
coping
of
wax
,
the
bees
can
cluster
and
crawl
over
the
comb
without
injuring
the
delicate
hexagonal
walls
.
These
walls
,
as
Professor
Miller
has
kindly
ascertained
for
me
,
vary
greatly
in
thickness
;
being
,
on
an
average
of
twelve
measurements
made
near
the
border
of
the
comb
,
1/352nd
of
an
inch
in
thickness
;
whereas
the
basal
rhomboidal
plates
are
thicker
,
nearly
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
two
,
having
a
mean
thickness
,
from
twenty
one
measurements
,
of
1/229th
of
an
inch
.
By
the
above
singular
manner
of
building
,
strength
is
continually
given
to
the
comb
,
with
the
utmost
ultimate
economy
of
wax
.
It
seems
at
first
to
add
to
the
difficulty
of
understanding
how
the
cells
are
made
,
that
a
multitude
of
bees
all
work
together
;
one
bee
after
working
a
short
time
at
one
cell
going
to
another
,
so
that
,
as
Huber
has
stated
,
a
score
of
individuals
work
even
at
the
commencement
of
the
first
cell
.
I
was
able
practically
to
show
this
fact
,
by
covering
the
edges
of
the
hexagonal
walls
of
a
single
cell
,
or
the
extreme
margin
of
the
circumferential
rim
of
a
growing
comb
,
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
melted
vermilion
wax
;
and
I
invariably
found
that
the
colour
was
most
delicately
diffused
by
the
bees
as
delicately
as
a
painter
could
have
done
it
with
his
brush
by
atoms
of
the
coloured
wax
having
been
taken
from
the
spot
on
which
it
had
been
placed
,
and
worked
into
the
growing
edges
of
the
cells
all
round
.
The
work
of
construction
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
balance
struck
between
many
bees
,
all
instinctively
standing
at
the
same
relative
distance
from
each
other
,
all
trying
to
sweep
equal
spheres
,
and
then
building
up
,
or
leaving
ungnawed
,
the
planes
of
intersection
between
these
spheres
.
It
was
really
curious
to
note
in
cases
of
difficulty
,
as
when
two
pieces
of
comb
met
at
an
angle
,
how
often
the
bees
would
pull
down
and
rebuild
in
different
ways
the
same
cell
,
sometimes
recurring
to
a
shape
which
they
had
at
first
rejected
.
When
bees
have
a
place
on
which
they
can
stand
in
their
proper
positions
for
working
,
for
instance
,
on
a
slip
of
wood
,
placed
directly
under
the
middle
of
a
comb
growing
downwards
,
so
that
the
comb
has
to
be
built
over
one
face
of
the
slip
in
this
case
the
bees
can
lay
the
foundations
of
one
wall
of
a
new
hexagon
,
in
its
strictly
proper
place
,
projecting
beyond
the
other
completed
cells
.
It
suffices
that
the
bees
should
be
enabled
to
stand
at
their
proper
relative
distances
from
each
other
and
from
the
walls
of
the
last
completed
cells
,
and
then
,
by
striking
imaginary
spheres
,
they
can
build
up
a
wall
intermediate
between
two
adjoining
spheres
;
but
,
as
far
as
I
have
seen
,
they
never
gnaw
away
and
finish
off
the
angles
of
a
cell
till
a
large
part
both
of
that
cell
and
of
the
adjoining
cells
has
been
built
.
This
capacity
in
bees
of
laying
down
under
certain
circumstances
a
rough
wall
in
its
proper
place
between
two
just
commenced
cells
,
is
important
,
as
it
bears
on
a
fact
,
which
seems
at
first
subversive
of
the
foregoing
theory
;
namely
,
that
the
cells
on
the
extreme
margin
of
wasp
combs
are
sometimes
strictly
hexagonal
;
but
I
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
subject
.
Nor
does
there
seem
to
me
any
great
difficulty
in
a
single
insect
(
as
in
the
case
of
a
queen
wasp
)
making
hexagonal
cells
,
if
she
were
to
work
alternately
on
the
inside
and
outside
of
two
or
three
cells
commenced
at
the
same
time
,
always
standing
at
the
proper
relative
distance
from
the
parts
of
the
cells
just
begun
,
sweeping
spheres
or
cylinders
,
and
building
up
intermediate
planes
.
As
natural
selection
acts
only
by
the
accumulation
of
slight
modifications
of
structure
or
instinct
,
each
profitable
to
the
individual
under
its
conditions
of
life
,
it
may
reasonably
be
asked
,
how
a
long
and
graduated
succession
of
modified
architectural
instincts
,
all
tending
towards
the
present
perfect
plan
of
construction
,
could
have
profited
the
progenitors
of
the
hive
bee
?
I
think
the
answer
is
not
difficult
:
cells
constructed
like
those
of
the
bee
or
the
wasp
gain
in
strength
,
and
save
much
in
labour
and
space
,
and
in
the
materials
of
which
they
are
constructed
.
With
respect
to
the
formation
of
wax
,
it
is
known
that
bees
are
often
hard
pressed
to
get
sufficient
nectar
,
and
I
am
informed
by
Mr
.
Tegetmeier
that
it
has
been
experimentally
proved
that
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pounds
of
dry
sugar
are
consumed
by
a
hive
of
bees
for
the
secretion
of
a
pound
of
wax
;
so
that
a
prodigious
quantity
of
fluid
nectar
must
be
collected
and
consumed
by
the
bees
in
a
hive
for
the
secretion
of
the
wax
necessary
for
the
construction
of
their
combs
.
Moreover
,
many
bees
have
to
remain
idle
for
many
days
during
the
process
of
secretion
.
A
large
store
of
honey
is
indispensable
to
support
a
large
stock
of
bees
during
the
winter
;
and
the
security
of
the
hive
is
known
mainly
to
depend
on
a
large
number
of
bees
being
supported
.
Hence
the
saving
of
wax
by
largely
saving
honey
and
the
time
consumed
in
collecting
the
honey
must
be
an
important
element
of
success
to
any
family
of
bees
.
Of
course
the
success
of
the
species
may
be
dependent
on
the
number
of
its
enemies
,
or
parasites
,
or
on
quite
distinct
causes
,
and
so
be
altogether
independent
of
the
quantity
of
honey
which
the
bees
can
collect
.
But
let
us
suppose
that
this
latter
circumstance
determined
,
as
it
probably
often
has
determined
,
whether
a
bee
allied
to
our
humble
bees
could
exist
in
large
numbers
in
any
country
;
and
let
us
further
suppose
that
the
community
lived
through
the
winter
,
and
consequently
required
a
store
of
honey
:
there
can
in
this
case
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
our
imaginary
humble
bee
if
a
slight
modification
in
her
instincts
led
her
to
make
her
waxen
cells
near
together
,
so
as
to
intersect
a
little
;
for
a
wall
in
common
even
to
two
adjoining
cells
would
save
some
little
labour
and
wax
.
Hence
it
would
continually
be
more
and
more
advantageous
to
our
humble
bees
,
if
they
were
to
make
their
cells
more
and
more
regular
,
nearer
together
,
and
aggregated
into
a
mass
,
like
the
cells
of
the
Melipona
;
for
in
this
case
a
large
part
of
the
bounding
surface
of
each
cell
would
serve
to
bound
the
adjoining
cells
,
and
much
labour
and
wax
would
be
saved
.
Again
,
from
the
same
cause
,
it
would
be
advantageous
to
the
Melipona
,
if
she
were
to
make
her
cells
closer
together
,
and
more
regular
in
every
way
than
at
present
;
for
then
,
as
we
have
seen
,
the
spherical
surfaces
would
wholly
disappear
and
be
replaced
by
plane
surfaces
;
and
the
Melipona
would
make
a
comb
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive
bee
.
Beyond
this
stage
of
perfection
in
architecture
,
natural
selection
could
not
lead
;
for
the
comb
of
the
hive
bee
,
as
far
as
we
can
see
,
is
absolutely
perfect
in
economising
labour
and
wax
.
Thus
,
as
I
believe
,
the
most
wonderful
of
all
known
instincts
,
that
of
the
hive
bee
,
can
be
explained
by
natural
selection
having
taken
advantage
of
numerous
,
successive
,
slight
modifications
of
simpler
instincts
;
natural
selection
having
,
by
slow
degrees
,
more
and
more
perfectly
led
the
bees
to
sweep
equal
spheres
at
a
given
distance
from
each
other
in
a
double
layer
,
and
to
build
up
and
excavate
the
wax
along
the
planes
of
intersection
;
the
bees
,
of
course
,
no
more
knowing
that
they
swept
their
spheres
at
one
particular
distance
from
each
other
,
than
they
know
what
are
the
several
angles
of
the
hexagonal
prisms
and
of
the
basal
rhombic
plates
;
the
motive
power
of
the
process
of
natural
selection
having
been
the
construction
of
cells
of
due
strength
and
of
the
proper
size
and
shape
for
the
larvae
,
this
being
effected
with
the
greatest
possible
economy
of
labour
and
wax
;
that
individual
swarm
which
thus
made
the
best
cells
with
least
labour
,
and
least
waste
of
honey
in
the
secretion
of
wax
,
having
succeeded
best
,
and
having
transmitted
their
newly
acquired
economical
instincts
to
new
swarms
,
which
in
their
turn
will
have
had
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
in
the
struggle
for
existence
.
Objections
to
the
Theory
of
Natural
Selection
as
applied
to
Instincts
:
Neuter
and
Sterile
Insects
It
has
been
objected
to
the
foregoing
view
of
the
origin
of
instincts
that
"
the
variations
of
structure
and
of
instinct
must
have
been
simultaneous
and
accurately
adjusted
to
each
other
,
as
a
modification
in
the
one
without
an
immediate
corresponding
change
in
the
other
would
have
been
fatal
.
"
The
force
of
this
objection
rests
entirely
on
the
assumption
that
the
changes
in
the
instincts
and
structure
are
abrupt
.
To
take
as
an
illustration
the
case
of
the
larger
titmouse
(
Parus
major
)
alluded
to
in
a
previous
chapter
;
this
bird
often
holds
the
seeds
of
the
yew
between
its
feet
on
a
branch
,
and
hammers
with
its
beak
till
it
gets
at
the
kernel
.
Now
what
special
difficulty
would
there
be
in
natural
selection
preserving
all
the
slight
individual
variations
in
the
shape
of
the
beak
,
which
were
better
and
better
adapted
to
break
open
the
seeds
,
until
a
beak
was
formed
,
as
well
constructed
for
this
purpose
as
that
of
the
nuthatch
,
at
the
same
time
that
habit
,
or
compulsion
,
or
spontaneous
variations
of
taste
,
led
the
bird
to
become
more
and
more
of
a
seed
eater
?
In
this
case
the
beak
is
supposed
to
be
slowly
modified
by
natural
selection
,
subsequently
to
,
but
in
accordance
with
,
slowly
changing
habits
or
taste
;
but
let
the
feet
of
the
titmouse
vary
and
grow
larger
from
correlation
with
the
beak
,
or
from
any
other
unknown
cause
,
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
such
larger
feet
would
lead
the
bird
to
climb
more
and
more
until
it
acquired
the
remarkable
climbing
instinct
and
power
of
the
nuthatch
.
In
this
case
a
gradual
change
of
structure
is
supposed
to
lead
to
changed
instinctive
habits
.
To
take
one
more
case
:
few
instincts
are
more
remarkable
than
that
which
leads
the
swift
of
the
Eastern
Islands
to
make
its
nest
wholly
of
inspissated
saliva
.
Some
birds
build
their
nests
of
mud
,
believed
to
be
moistened
with
saliva
;
and
one
of
the
swifts
of
North
America
makes
its
nest
(
as
I
have
seen
)
of
sticks
agglutinated
with
saliva
,
and
even
with
flakes
of
this
substance
.
Is
it
then
very
improbable
that
the
natural
selection
of
individual
swifts
,
which
secreted
more
and
more
saliva
,
should
at
last
produce
a
species
with
instincts
leading
it
to
neglect
other
materials
,
and
to
make
its
nest
exclusively
of
inspissated
saliva
?
And
so
in
other
cases
.
It
must
,
however
,
be
admitted
that
in
many
instances
we
cannot
conjecture
whether
it
was
instinct
or
structure
which
first
varied
.
No
doubt
many
instincts
of
very
difficult
explanation
could
be
opposed
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
cases
,
in
which
we
cannot
see
how
an
instinct
could
have
originated
;
cases
,
in
which
no
intermediate
gradations
are
known
to
exist
;
cases
of
instincts
of
such
trifling
importance
,
that
they
could
hardly
have
been
acted
on
by
natural
selection
;
cases
of
instincts
almost
identically
the
same
in
animals
so
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
,
that
we
cannot
account
for
their
similarity
by
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
,
and
consequently
must
believe
that
they
were
independently
acquired
through
natural
selection
.
I
will
not
here
enter
on
these
several
cases
,
but
will
confine
myself
to
one
special
difficulty
,
which
at
first
appeared
to
me
insuperable
,
and
actually
fatal
to
the
whole
theory
.
I
allude
to
the
neuters
or
sterile
females
in
insect
communities
;
for
these
neuters
often
differ
widely
in
instinct
and
in
structure
from
both
the
males
and
fertile
females
,
and
yet
,
from
being
sterile
,
they
cannot
propagate
their
kind
.
The
subject
well
deserves
to
be
discussed
at
great
length
,
but
I
will
here
take
only
a
single
case
,
that
of
working
or
sterile
ants
.
How
the
workers
have
been
rendered
sterile
is
a
difficulty
;
but
not
much
greater
than
that
of
any
other
striking
modification
of
structure
;
for
it
can
be
shown
that
some
insects
and
other
articulate
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
occasionally
become
sterile
;
and
if
such
insects
had
been
social
,
and
it
had
been
profitable
to
the
community
that
a
number
should
have
been
annually
born
capable
of
work
,
but
incapable
of
procreation
,
I
can
see
no
especial
difficulty
in
this
having
been
effected
through
natural
selection
.
But
I
must
pass
over
this
preliminary
difficulty
.
The
great
difficulty
lies
in
the
working
ants
differing
widely
from
both
the
males
and
the
fertile
females
in
structure
,
as
in
the
shape
of
the
thorax
,
and
in
being
destitute
of
wings
and
sometimes
of
eyes
,
and
in
instinct
.
As
far
as
instinct
alone
is
concerned
,
the
wonderful
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
workers
and
the
perfect
females
,
would
have
been
better
exemplified
by
the
hive
bee
.
If
a
working
ant
or
other
neuter
insect
had
been
an
ordinary
animal
,
I
should
have
unhesitatingly
assumed
that
all
its
characters
had
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
;
namely
,
by
individuals
having
been
born
with
slight
profitable
modifications
,
which
were
inherited
by
the
offspring
;
and
that
these
again
varied
and
again
were
selected
,
and
so
onwards
.
But
with
the
working
ant
we
have
an
insect
differing
greatly
from
its
parents
,
yet
absolutely
sterile
;
so
that
it
could
never
have
transmitted
successively
acquired
modifications
of
structure
or
instinct
to
its
progeny
.
It
may
well
be
asked
how
is
it
possible
to
reconcile
this
case
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
?
First
,
let
it
be
remembered
that
we
have
innumerable
instances
,
both
in
our
domestic
productions
and
in
those
in
a
state
of
nature
,
of
all
sorts
of
differences
of
inherited
structure
which
are
correlated
with
certain
ages
,
and
with
either
sex
.
We
have
differences
correlated
not
only
with
one
sex
,
but
with
that
short
period
when
the
reproductive
system
is
active
,
as
in
the
nuptial
plumage
of
many
birds
,
and
in
the
hooked
jaws
of
the
male
salmon
.
We
have
even
slight
differences
in
the
horns
of
different
breeds
of
cattle
in
relation
to
an
artificially
imperfect
state
of
the
male
sex
;
for
oxen
of
certain
breeds
have
longer
horns
than
the
oxen
of
other
breeds
,
relatively
to
the
length
of
the
horns
in
both
the
bulls
and
cows
of
these
same
breeds
.
Hence
I
can
see
no
great
difficulty
in
any
character
becoming
correlated
with
the
sterile
condition
of
certain
members
of
insect
communities
:
the
difficulty
lies
in
understanding
how
such
correlated
modifications
of
structure
could
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
natural
selection
.
This
difficulty
,
though
appearing
insuperable
,
is
lessened
,
or
,
as
I
believe
,
disappears
,
when
it
is
remembered
that
selection
may
be
applied
to
the
family
,
as
well
as
to
the
individual
,
and
may
thus
gain
the
desired
end
.
Breeders
of
cattle
wish
the
flesh
and
fat
to
be
well
marbled
together
:
an
animal
thus
characterised
has
been
slaughtered
,
but
the
breeder
has
gone
with
confidence
to
the
same
stock
and
has
succeeded
.
Such
faith
may
be
placed
in
the
power
of
selection
,
that
a
breed
of
cattle
,
always
yielding
oxen
with
extraordinarily
long
horns
,
could
,
it
is
probable
,
be
formed
by
carefully
watching
which
individual
bulls
and
cows
,
when
matched
,
produced
oxen
with
the
longest
horns
;
and
yet
no
ox
would
ever
have
propagated
its
kind
.
Here
is
a
better
and
real
illustration
:
according
to
M
.
Verlot
,
some
varieties
of
the
double
annual
Stock
from
having
been
long
and
carefully
selected
to
the
right
degree
,
always
produce
a
large
proportion
of
seedlings
bearing
double
and
quite
sterile
flowers
;
but
they
likewise
yield
some
single
and
fertile
plants
.
These
latter
,
by
which
alone
the
variety
can
be
propagated
,
may
be
compared
with
the
fertile
male
and
female
ants
,
is
ants
,
and
the
double
sterile
plants
with
the
neuters
of
the
same
community
.
As
with
the
varieties
of
the
stock
,
so
with
social
insects
,
selection
has
been
applied
to
the
family
,
and
not
to
the
individual
,
for
the
sake
of
gaining
a
serviceable
end
.
Hence
we
may
conclude
that
slight
modifications
of
structure
or
of
instinct
,
correlated
with
the
sterile
condition
of
certain
members
of
the
community
,
have
proved
advantageous
:
consequently
the
fertile
males
and
females
have
flourished
,
and
transmitted
to
their
fertile
offspring
a
tendency
to
produce
sterile
members
with
the
same
modifications
.
This
process
must
have
been
repeated
many
times
,
until
that
prodigious
amount
of
difference
between
the
fertile
and
sterile
females
of
the
same
species
has
been
produced
,
which
we
see
in
many
social
insects
.
But
we
have
not
as
yet
touched
on
the
acme
of
the
difficulty
;
namely
,
the
fact
that
the
neuters
of
several
ants
differ
,
not
only
from
the
fertile
females
and
males
,
but
from
each
other
,
sometimes
to
an
almost
incredible
degree
,
and
are
thus
divided
into
two
or
even
three
castes
.
The
castes
,
moreover
,
do
not
commonly
graduate
into
each
other
,
but
are
perfectly
well
defined
;
being
as
distinct
from
each
other
as
are
any
two
species
of
the
same
genus
,
or
rather
as
any
two
genera
of
the
same
family
.
Thus
in
Eciton
,
there
are
working
and
soldier
neuters
,
with
jaws
and
instincts
extraordinarily
different
:
in
Cryptocerus
,
the
workers
of
one
caste
alone
carry
a
wonderful
sort
of
shield
on
their
heads
,
the
use
of
which
is
quite
unknown
:
in
the
Mexican
Myrmecoeystus
,
the
workers
of
one
caste
never
leave
the
nest
;
they
are
fed
by
the
workers
of
another
caste
,
and
they
have
an
enormously
developed
abdomen
which
secretes
a
sort
of
honey
,
supplying
the
place
of
that
excreted
by
the
aphides
,
or
the
domestic
cattle
as
they
may
be
called
,
which
our
European
ants
guard
and
imprison
.
It
will
indeed
be
thought
that
I
have
an
overweening
confidence
in
the
principle
of
natural
selection
,
when
I
do
not
admit
that
such
wonderful
and
well
established
facts
at
once
annihilate
the
theory
.
In
the
simpler
case
of
neuter
insects
all
of
one
caste
,
which
,
as
I
believe
,
have
been
rendered
different
from
the
fertile
males
and
females
through
natural
selection
,
we
may
conclude
from
the
analogy
of
ordinary
variations
,
that
the
successive
,
slight
,
profitable
modifications
did
not
first
arise
in
all
the
neuters
in
the
same
nest
,
but
in
some
few
alone
;
and
that
by
the
survival
of
the
communities
with
females
which
produced
most
INSTINCT
is
neuters
having
the
advantageous
modifications
,
all
the
neuters
ultimately
came
to
be
thus
characterised
.
According
to
this
view
we
ought
occasionally
to
find
in
the
same
nest
neuter
insects
,
presenting
gradations
of
structure
;
and
this
we
do
find
,
even
not
rarely
,
considering
how
few
neuter
insects
out
of
Europe
have
been
carefully
examined
.
Mr
.
F
.
Smith
has
shown
that
the
neuters
of
several
British
ants
differ
surprisingly
from
each
other
in
size
and
sometimes
in
colour
;
and
that
the
extreme
forms
can
be
linked
together
by
individuals
taken
out
of
the
same
nest
:
I
have
myself
compared
perfect
gradations
of
this
kind
.
It
sometimes
happens
that
the
larger
or
the
smaller
sized
workers
are
the
most
numerous
;
or
that
both
large
and
small
are
numerous
,
whilst
those
of
an
intermediate
size
are
scanty
in
numbers
.
Formica
lava
has
larger
and
smaller
workers
,
with
some
few
of
intermediate
size
;
and
,
in
this
species
,
as
Mr
.
F
.
Smith
has
observed
,
the
larger
workers
have
simple
eyes
(
ocelli
)
,
which
though
small
can
be
plainly
distinguished
,
whereas
the
smaller
workers
have
their
ocelli
rudimentary
.
Having
carefully
dissected
several
specimens
of
these
workers
,
I
can
affirm
that
the
eyes
are
far
more
rudimentary
in
the
smaller
workers
than
can
be
accounted
for
merely
by
their
proportionally
lesser
size
;
and
I
fully
believe
,
though
I
dare
not
assert
so
positively
,
that
the
workers
of
intermediate
size
have
their
ocelli
in
an
exactly
intermediate
condition
.
So
that
here
we
have
two
bodies
of
sterile
workers
in
the
same
nest
,
differing
not
only
in
size
,
but
in
their
organs
of
vision
,
yet
connected
by
some
few
members
in
an
intermediate
condition
.
I
may
digress
by
adding
,
that
if
the
smaller
workers
had
been
the
most
useful
to
the
community
,
and
those
males
and
females
had
been
continually
selected
,
which
produced
more
and
more
of
the
smaller
workers
,
until
all
the
workers
were
in
this
condition
;
we
should
then
have
had
a
species
of
ant
with
neuters
in
nearly
the
same
condition
as
those
of
Myrmica
.
For
the
workers
of
Myrmica
have
not
even
rudiments
of
ocelli
,
though
the
male
and
female
ants
of
this
genus
have
well
developed
ocelli
.
I
may
give
one
other
case
:
so
confidently
did
I
expect
occasionally
to
find
gradations
of
important
structures
between
the
different
castes
of
neuters
in
the
same
species
,
that
I
gladly
availed
myself
of
Mr
.
F
.
Smith's
offer
of
numerous
specimens
from
the
same
nest
of
the
driver
ant
(
Anomma
)
of
West
Africa
.
The
reader
will
perhaps
best
appreciate
the
amount
of
difference
in
these
workers
,
by
my
giving
not
the
actual
measurements
,
but
a
strictly
accurate
illustration
:
the
difference
was
the
same
as
if
we
were
to
see
a
set
of
workmen
building
a
house
,
of
whom
many
were
five
feet
four
inches
high
,
and
many
sixteen
feet
high
;
but
we
must
in
addition
suppose
that
the
larger
workmen
had
heads
four
instead
of
three
times
as
big
as
those
of
the
smaller
men
,
and
jaws
nearly
five
times
as
big
.
The
jaws
,
moreover
,
of
the
working
ants
of
the
several
sizes
differed
wonderfully
in
shape
,
and
in
the
form
and
number
of
the
teeth
.
But
the
important
fact
for
us
is
,
that
,
though
the
workers
can
be
grouped
into
castes
of
different
size
,
yet
they
graduate
insensibly
into
each
other
,
as
does
the
widely
different
structure
of
their
jaws
.
I
speak
confidently
on
this
latter
point
,
as
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
made
drawings
for
me
,
with
the
camera
lucida
,
of
the
jaws
which
I
dissected
from
the
workers
of
the
several
sizes
.
Mr
.
Bates
,
in
his
interesting
Naturalist
on
the
Amazons
,
has
described
analogous
cases
.
With
these
facts
before
me
,
I
believe
that
natural
selection
,
by
acting
on
the
fertile
ants
or
parents
,
could
form
a
species
which
should
regularly
produce
neuters
,
all
of
large
size
with
one
form
of
jaw
,
or
all
of
small
size
with
widely
different
jaws
;
or
lastly
,
and
this
is
the
greatest
difficulty
,
one
set
of
workers
of
one
size
and
structure
,
and
simultaneously
another
set
of
workers
of
a
different
size
and
structure
;
a
graduated
series
having
first
been
formed
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
driver
ant
,
and
then
the
extreme
forms
having
been
produced
in
greater
and
greater
numbers
,
through
the
survival
of
the
parents
which
generated
them
,
until
none
with
an
intermediate
structure
were
produced
.
An
analogous
explanation
has
been
given
by
Mr
.
Wallace
,
of
the
equally
complex
case
,
of
certain
Malayan
butterflies
regularly
appearing
under
two
or
even
three
distinct
female
forms
;
and
by
Fritz
Muller
,
of
certain
Brazilian
crustaceans
likewise
appearing
under
two
widely
distinct
male
forms
.
But
this
subject
need
not
here
be
discussed
.
I
have
now
explained
how
,
as
I
believe
,
the
wonderful
fact
of
two
distinctly
defined
castes
of
sterile
workers
existing
in
the
same
nest
,
both
widely
different
from
each
other
and
from
their
parents
,
has
originated
.
We
can
see
how
useful
their
production
may
have
been
to
a
social
community
of
ants
,
on
the
same
principle
that
the
division
of
labour
is
useful
to
civilised
man
.
Ants
,
however
,
work
by
inherited
instincts
and
by
inherited
organs
or
tools
,
whilst
man
works
by
acquired
knowledge
and
manufactured
instruments
.
But
I
must
confess
,
that
,
with
all
my
faith
in
natural
selection
,
I
should
never
have
anticipated
that
this
principle
could
have
been
efficient
in
so
high
a
degree
,
had
not
the
case
of
these
neuter
insects
led
me
to
this
conclusion
.
I
have
,
therefore
,
discussed
this
case
,
at
some
little
but
wholly
insufficient
length
,
in
order
to
show
the
power
of
natural
selection
,
and
likewise
because
this
is
by
far
the
most
serious
special
difficulty
which
my
theory
has
encountered
.
The
case
,
also
,
is
very
interesting
,
as
it
proves
that
with
animals
,
as
with
plants
,
any
amount
of
modification
may
be
effected
by
the
accumulation
of
numerous
,
slight
,
spontaneous
variations
,
which
are
in
any
way
profitable
,
without
exercise
or
habit
having
been
brought
into
play
.
For
peculiar
habits
confined
to
the
workers
or
sterile
females
,
however
long
they
might
be
followed
,
could
not
possibly
affect
the
males
and
fertile
females
,
which
alone
leave
descendants
.
I
am
surprised
that
no
one
has
hitherto
advanced
this
demonstrative
case
of
neuter
insects
,
against
the
well
known
doctrine
of
inherited
habit
,
as
advanced
by
Lamarck
.
Summary
I
have
endeavoured
in
this
chapter
briefly
to
show
that
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
vary
,
and
that
the
variations
are
inherited
.
Still
more
briefly
I
have
attempted
to
show
that
instincts
vary
slightly
in
a
state
of
nature
.
No
one
will
dispute
that
instincts
are
of
the
highest
importance
to
each
animal
.
Therefore
there
is
no
real
difficulty
,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
,
in
natural
selection
accumulating
to
any
extent
slight
modifications
of
instinct
which
are
in
any
way
useful
.
In
many
cases
habit
or
use
and
disuse
have
probably
come
into
play
.
I
do
not
pretend
that
the
facts
given
in
this
chapter
strengthen
in
any
great
degree
my
theory
;
but
none
of
the
cases
of
difficulty
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
,
annihilate
it
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
fact
that
instincts
are
not
always
absolutely
perfect
and
are
liable
to
mistakes
;
that
no
instinct
can
be
shown
to
have
been
produced
for
the
good
of
other
animals
,
though
animals
take
advantage
of
the
instincts
of
others
;
that
the
canon
in
natural
history
,
of
"
Natura
non
facit
saltum
,
"
is
applicable
to
instincts
as
well
as
to
corporeal
structure
,
and
is
plainly
explicable
on
the
foregoing
views
,
but
is
otherwise
inexplicable
,
all
tend
to
corroborate
the
theory
of
natural
selection
.
This
theory
is
also
strengthened
by
some
few
other
facts
in
regard
to
instincts
;
as
by
that
common
case
of
closely
allied
,
but
distinct
species
,
when
inhabiting
distant
parts
of
the
world
and
living
under
considerably
different
conditions
of
life
,
yet
often
retaining
nearly
the
same
instincts
.
For
instance
,
we
can
understand
,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
,
how
it
is
that
the
thrush
of
tropical
South
America
lines
its
nest
with
mud
,
in
the
same
peculiar
manner
as
does
our
British
thrush
;
how
it
is
that
the
hornbills
of
Africa
and
India
have
the
same
extraordinary
instinct
of
plastering
up
and
imprisoning
the
females
in
a
hole
in
a
tree
,
with
only
a
small
hole
left
in
the
plaster
through
which
the
males
feed
them
and
their
young
when
hatched
;
how
it
is
that
the
male
wrens
(
Troglodytes
)
of
North
America
build
"
cocknests
,
"
to
roost
in
,
like
the
males
of
our
kittywrens
,
a
habit
wholly
unlike
that
of
any
other
known
bird
.
Finally
,
it
may
not
be
a
logical
deduction
,
but
to
my
imagination
it
is
far
more
satisfactory
to
look
at
such
instincts
as
the
young
cuckoo
ejecting
its
foster
brothers
,
ants
making
slaves
,
the
larvae
of
ichneumonidea
feeding
within
the
live
bodies
of
caterpillars
,
not
as
specially
endowed
or
created
instincts
,
but
as
small
consequences
of
one
general
law
leading
to
the
advancement
of
all
organic
beings
,
namely
,
multiply
,
vary
,
let
the
strongest
live
and
the
weakest
die
.
CHAPTER
IX
HYBRIDISM
THE
view
commonly
entertained
by
naturalists
is
that
species
,
when
intercrossed
,
have
been
specially
endowed
with
sterility
,
in
order
to
prevent
their
confusion
.
This
view
certainly
seems
at
first
highly
probable
,
for
species
living
together
could
hardly
have
been
kept
distinct
had
they
been
capable
of
freely
crossing
.
The
subject
is
in
many
ways
important
for
us
,
more
especially
as
the
sterility
of
species
when
first
crossed
,
and
that
of
their
hybrid
offspring
,
cannot
have
been
acquired
,
as
I
shall
show
,
by
the
preservation
of
successive
profitable
degrees
of
sterility
.
It
is
an
incidental
result
of
differences
in
the
reproductive
systems
of
the
parent
species
.
In
treating
this
subject
,
two
classes
of
facts
,
to
a
large
extent
fundamentally
different
,
have
generally
been
confounded
;
namely
,
the
sterility
of
species
when
first
crossed
,
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
produced
from
them
.
Pure
species
have
of
course
their
organs
of
reproduction
in
a
perfect
condition
,
yet
when
intercrossed
they
produce
either
few
or
no
offspring
.
Hybrids
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
their
reproductive
organs
functionally
impotent
,
as
may
be
clearly
seen
in
the
state
of
the
male
element
in
both
plants
and
animals
;
though
the
formative
organs
themselves
are
perfect
in
structure
,
as
far
as
the
microscope
reveals
.
In
the
first
case
the
two
sexual
elements
which
go
to
form
the
embryo
are
perfect
;
in
the
second
case
they
are
either
not
at
all
developed
,
or
are
imperfectly
developed
.
This
distinction
is
important
,
when
the
cause
of
the
sterility
,
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
,
has
to
be
considered
.
The
distinction
probably
has
been
slurred
over
,
owing
to
the
sterility
in
both
cases
being
looked
on
as
a
special
endowment
,
beyond
the
province
of
our
reasoning
powers
.
The
fertility
of
varieties
,
that
is
of
the
forms
known
or
believed
to
be
descended
from
common
parents
,
when
crossed
,
and
likewise
the
fertility
of
their
mongrel
offspring
,
is
,
with
reference
to
my
theory
,
of
equal
importance
with
the
sterility
of
species
;
for
it
seems
to
make
a
broad
and
clear
distinction
between
varieties
and
species
.
Degrees
of
Sterility
.
First
,
for
the
sterility
of
species
when
crossed
and
of
their
hybrid
offspring
.
It
is
impossible
to
study
the
several
memoirs
and
works
of
those
two
conscientious
and
admirable
observers
,
Kolreuter
and
Gartner
,
who
almost
devoted
their
lives
to
this
subject
,
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
high
generality
of
some
degree
of
sterility
.
Kolreuter
makes
the
rule
universal
;
but
then
he
cuts
the
knot
,
for
in
ten
cases
in
which
he
found
two
forms
,
considered
by
most
authors
as
distinct
species
,
quite
fertile
together
,
he
unhesitatingly
ranks
them
as
varieties
.
Gartner
,
also
,
makes
the
rule
equally
universal
;
and
he
disputes
the
entire
fertility
of
Kolreuter's
ten
cases
.
But
in
these
and
in
many
other
cases
,
Gartner
is
obliged
carefully
to
count
the
seeds
,
in
order
to
show
that
there
is
any
degree
of
sterility
.
He
always
compares
the
maximum
number
of
seeds
produced
by
two
species
when
first
crossed
,
and
the
maximum
produced
by
their
hybrid
offspring
,
with
the
average
number
produced
by
both
pure
parent
species
in
a
state
of
nature
.
But
causes
of
serious
error
here
intervene
:
a
plant
,
to
be
hybridised
,
must
be
castrated
,
and
,
what
is
often
more
important
,
must
be
secluded
in
order
to
prevent
pollen
being
brought
to
it
by
insects
from
other
plants
.
Nearly
all
the
plants
experimented
on
by
Gartner
were
potted
,
and
were
kept
in
a
chamber
in
his
house
.
That
these
processes
are
often
injurious
to
the
fertility
of
a
plant
cannot
be
doubted
;
for
Gartner
gives
in
his
table
about
a
score
of
cases
of
plants
which
he
castrated
,
and
artificially
fertilised
with
their
own
pollen
,
and
(
excluding
all
cases
such
as
the
Leguminosae
,
in
which
there
is
an
acknowledged
difficulty
in
the
manipulation
)
half
of
these
twenty
plants
had
their
fertility
in
some
degree
impaired
.
Moreover
,
as
Gartner
repeatedly
crossed
some
forms
,
such
as
the
common
red
and
blue
pimpernels
(
Anagallis
arvensis
and
caerulea
)
,
which
the
best
botanists
rank
as
varieties
,
and
found
them
absolutely
sterile
,
we
may
doubt
whether
many
species
are
really
so
sterile
,
when
intercrossed
,
as
he
believed
.
It
is
certain
,
on
the
one
hand
,
that
the
sterility
of
various
species
when
crossed
is
so
different
in
degree
and
graduates
away
so
insensibly
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
the
fertility
of
pure
species
is
so
easily
affected
by
various
circumstances
,
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
is
most
difficult
to
say
where
perfect
fertility
ends
and
sterility
begins
.
I
think
no
better
evidence
of
this
can
be
required
than
that
the
two
most
experienced
observers
who
have
ever
lived
,
namely
Kolreuter
and
Gartner
,
arrived
at
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
regard
to
some
of
the
very
same
forms
.
It
is
also
most
instructive
to
compare
but
I
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
details
the
evidence
advanced
by
our
best
botanists
on
the
question
whether
certain
doubtful
forms
should
be
ranked
as
species
or
varieties
,
with
the
evidence
from
fertility
adduced
by
different
hybridisers
,
or
by
the
same
observer
from
experiments
made
during
different
years
.
It
can
thus
be
shown
that
neither
sterility
nor
fertility
affords
any
certain
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
.
The
evidence
from
this
source
graduates
away
,
and
is
doubtful
in
the
same
degree
as
is
the
evidence
derived
from
other
constitutional
and
structural
differences
.
In
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
in
successive
generations
:
though
Gartner
was
enabled
to
rear
some
hybrids
,
carefully
guarding
them
from
a
cross
with
either
pure
parent
,
for
six
or
seven
,
and
in
one
case
for
ten
generations
,
yet
he
asserts
positively
that
their
fertility
never
increases
,
but
generally
decreases
greatly
and
suddenly
.
With
respect
to
this
decrease
,
it
may
first
be
noticed
that
when
any
deviation
in
structure
or
constitution
is
common
to
both
parents
,
this
is
often
transmitted
in
an
augmented
degree
to
the
offspring
;
and
both
sexual
elements
in
hybrid
plants
are
already
affected
in
some
degree
.
But
I
believe
that
their
fertility
has
been
diminished
in
nearly
all
these
cases
by
an
independent
cause
,
namely
,
by
too
close
interbreeding
.
I
have
made
so
many
experiments
and
collected
so
many
facts
,
showing
on
the
one
hand
that
an
occasional
cross
with
a
distinct
individual
or
variety
increases
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
the
offspring
,
and
on
the
other
hand
that
very
close
interbreeding
lessens
their
vigour
and
fertility
,
that
I
cannot
doubt
the
correctness
of
this
conclusion
.
Hybrids
are
seldom
raised
by
experimentalists
in
great
numbers
;
and
as
the
parent
species
,
or
other
allied
hybrids
,
generally
grow
in
the
same
garden
,
the
visits
of
insects
must
be
carefully
prevented
during
the
flowering
season
:
hence
hybrids
,
if
left
to
themselves
,
will
generally
be
fertilised
during
each
generation
by
pollen
from
the
same
flower
;
and
this
would
probably
be
injurious
to
their
fertility
,
already
lessened
by
their
hybrid
origin
.
I
am
strengthened
in
this
conviction
by
a
remarkable
statement
repeatedly
made
by
Gartner
,
namely
,
that
if
even
the
less
fertile
hybrids
be
artificially
fertilised
with
hybrid
pollen
of
the
same
kind
,
their
fertility
,
notwithstanding
the
frequent
ill
effects
from
manipulation
,
sometimes
decidedly
increases
,
and
goes
on
increasing
.
Now
,
in
the
process
of
artificial
fertilisation
,
pollen
is
as
often
taken
by
chance
(
as
I
know
from
my
own
experience
)
from
the
anthers
of
another
flower
,
as
from
the
anthers
of
the
flower
itself
which
is
to
be
fertilised
;
so
that
a
cross
between
two
flowers
,
though
probably
often
on
the
same
plant
,
would
be
thus
effected
.
Moreover
,
whenever
complicated
experiments
are
in
progress
,
so
careful
an
observer
as
Gartner
would
have
castrated
his
hybrids
,
and
this
would
have
ensured
in
each
generation
a
cross
with
pollen
from
a
distinct
flower
,
either
from
the
same
plant
or
from
another
plant
of
the
same
hybrid
nature
.
And
thus
,
the
strange
fact
of
an
increase
of
fertility
in
the
successive
generations
of
artificially
fertilised
hybrids
,
in
contrast
with
those
spontaneously
self
fertilised
,
may
,
as
I
believe
,
be
accounted
for
by
too
close
interbreeding
having
been
avoided
.
Now
let
us
turn
to
the
results
arrived
at
by
a
third
most
experienced
hybridiser
,
namely
,
the
Hon
.
and
Rev
.
W
.
Herbert
.
He
is
as
emphatic
in
his
conclusion
that
some
hybrids
are
perfectly
fertile
as
fertile
as
the
pure
parent
species
as
are
Kolreuter
and
Gartner
that
some
degree
of
sterility
between
distinct
species
is
a
universal
law
of
nature
.
He
experimented
on
some
of
the
very
same
species
as
did
Gartner
.
The
difference
in
their
results
may
,
I
think
,
be
in
part
accounted
for
by
Herbert's
great
horticultural
skill
,
and
by
his
having
hot
houses
at
his
command
.
Of
his
many
important
statements
I
will
here
give
only
a
single
one
as
an
example
,
namely
,
that
"
every
ovule
in
a
pod
of
Crinum
capense
fertilised
by
C
.
revolutum
produced
a
plant
,
which
I
never
saw
to
occur
in
a
case
of
its
natural
fecundation
.
"
So
that
here
we
have
perfect
or
even
more
than
commonly
perfect
fertility
,
in
a
first
cross
between
two
distinct
species
.
This
case
of
the
Crinum
leads
me
to
refer
to
a
singular
fact
,
namely
,
that
individual
plants
of
certain
species
of
Lobelia
,
Verbascum
and
Passiflora
,
can
easily
be
fertilised
by
pollen
from
a
distinct
species
,
but
not
by
pollen
from
the
same
plant
,
though
this
pollen
can
be
proved
to
be
perfectly
sound
by
fertilising
other
plants
or
species
.
In
the
genus
Hippeastrum
,
in
Corydalis
as
shown
by
Professor
Hildebrand
,
in
various
orchids
as
shown
by
Mr
.
Scott
and
Fritz
Muller
,
all
the
individuals
are
in
this
peculiar
condition
.
So
that
with
some
species
,
certain
abnormal
individuals
,
and
in
other
species
all
the
individuals
,
can
actually
be
hybridised
much
more
readily
than
they
can
be
fertilised
by
pollen
from
the
same
individual
plant!
To
give
one
instance
,
a
bulb
of
Hippeastrum
aulicum
produced
four
flowers
;
three
were
fertilised
by
Herbert
with
their
own
pollen
,
and
the
fourth
was
subsequently
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
a
compound
hybrid
descended
from
three
distinct
species
:
the
result
was
that
"
the
ovaries
of
the
three
first
flowers
soon
ceased
to
grow
,
and
after
a
few
days
perished
entirely
,
whereas
the
pod
impregnated
by
the
pollen
of
the
hybrid
made
vigorous
growth
and
rapid
progress
to
maturity
,
and
bore
good
seed
,
which
vegetated
freely
.
"
Mr
.
Herbert
tried
similar
experiments
during
many
years
,
and
always
with
the
same
result
.
These
cases
serve
to
show
on
what
slight
and
mysterious
causes
the
lesser
or
greater
fertility
of
a
species
sometimes
depends
.
The
practical
experiments
of
horticulturists
,
though
not
made
with
scientific
precision
,
deserve
some
notice
.
It
is
notorious
in
how
complicated
a
manner
the
species
of
Pelargonium
,
Fuchsia
,
Calceolaria
,
Petunia
,
Rhododendron
,
&c
.
,
have
been
crossed
,
yet
many
of
these
hybrids
seed
freely
.
For
instance
,
Herbert
asserts
that
a
hybrid
from
Calceolaria
integrifolia
and
plantaginea
,
species
most
widely
dissimilar
in
general
habit
,
"
reproduces
itself
as
perfectly
as
if
it
had
been
a
natural
species
from
the
mountains
of
Chili
.
"
I
have
taken
some
pains
to
ascertain
the
degree
of
fertility
of
some
of
the
complex
crosses
of
rhododendrons
,
and
I
am
assured
that
many
of
them
are
perfectly
fertile
.
Mr
.
C
.
Noble
,
for
instance
,
informs
me
that
he
raises
stocks
for
grafting
from
a
hybrid
between
Rhod
.
ponticum
and
catawbiense
,
and
that
this
hybrid
"
seeds
as
freely
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
.
"
Had
hybrids
when
fairly
treated
,
always
gone
on
decreasing
in
fertility
in
each
successive
generation
,
as
Gartner
believed
to
be
the
case
,
the
fact
would
have
been
notorious
to
nurserymen
.
Horticulturists
raise
large
beds
of
the
same
hybrid
,
and
such
alone
are
fairly
treated
,
for
by
insect
agency
the
several
individuals
are
allowed
to
cross
freely
with
each
other
,
and
the
injurious
influence
of
close
interbreeding
is
thus
prevented
.
Any
one
may
readily
convince
himself
of
the
efficiency
of
insect
agency
by
examining
the
flowers
of
the
more
sterile
kinds
of
hybrid
rhododendrons
,
which
produce
no
pollen
for
he
will
find
on
their
stigmas
plenty
of
pollen
brought
from
other
flowers
.
In
regard
to
animals
,
much
fewer
experiments
have
been
carefully
tried
than
with
plants
.
If
our
systematic
arrangements
can
be
trusted
,
that
is
,
if
the
genera
of
animals
are
as
distinct
from
each
other
as
are
the
genera
of
plants
,
then
we
may
infer
that
animals
more
widely
distinct
in
the
scale
of
nature
can
be
crossed
more
easily
than
in
the
case
of
plants
;
but
the
hybrids
themselves
are
,
I
think
,
more
sterile
.
It
should
,
however
,
be
borne
in
mind
that
,
owing
to
few
animals
breeding
freely
under
confinement
,
few
experiments
have
been
fairly
tried
:
for
instance
,
the
canary
bird
has
been
crossed
with
nine
distinct
species
of
finches
,
but
,
as
not
one
of
these
breeds
freely
in
confinement
,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
that
the
first
crosses
between
them
and
the
canary
,
or
that
their
hybrids
,
should
be
perfectly
fertile
.
Again
,
with
respect
to
the
fertility
in
successive
generations
of
the
more
fertile
hybrid
animals
,
I
hardly
know
of
an
instance
in
which
two
families
of
the
same
hybrid
have
been
raised
at
the
same
time
from
different
parents
,
so
as
to
avoid
the
ill
effects
of
close
interbreeding
.
On
the
contrary
,
brothers
and
sisters
have
usually
been
crossed
in
each
successive
generation
,
in
opposition
to
the
constantly
repeated
admonition
of
every
breeder
.
And
in
this
case
,
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
inherent
sterility
in
the
hybrids
should
have
gone
on
increasing
.
Although
I
know
of
hardly
any
thoroughly
well
authenticated
cases
of
perfectly
fertile
hybrid
animals
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
hybrids
from
Cervulus
vaginalis
and
reevesii
,
and
from
Phasianus
colchicus
with
P
.
torquatus
,
are
perfectly
fertile
.
M
.
Quatrefages
states
that
the
hybrids
from
two
moths
(
Bombyx
cynthia
and
arrindia
)
were
proved
in
Paris
to
be
fertile
inter
se
for
eight
generations
.
It
has
lately
been
asserted
that
two
such
distinct
species
as
the
hare
and
rabbit
,
when
they
can
be
got
to
breed
together
,
produce
offspring
which
are
highly
fertile
when
crossed
with
one
of
the
parent
species
.
The
hybrids
from
the
common
and
Chinese
geese
(
A
.
cygnoides
)
,
species
which
are
so
different
that
they
are
generally
ranked
in
distinct
genera
,
have
often
bred
in
this
country
with
either
pure
parent
,
and
in
one
single
instance
they
have
bred
inter
se
.
This
was
effected
by
Mr
.
Eyton
,
who
raised
two
hybrids
from
the
same
parents
,
but
from
different
hatches
;
and
from
these
two
birds
he
raised
no
less
than
eight
hybrids
(
grandchildren
of
the
pure
geese
)
from
one
nest
.
In
India
,
however
,
these
cross
bred
geese
must
be
far
more
fertile
;
for
I
am
assured
by
two
eminently
capable
judges
,
namely
Mr
.
Blyth
and
Capt
.
Hutton
,
that
whole
flocks
of
these
crossed
geese
are
kept
in
various
parts
of
the
country
;
and
as
they
are
kept
for
profit
,
where
neither
pure
parent
species
exists
,
they
must
certainly
be
highly
or
perfectly
fertile
.
With
our
domesticated
animals
,
the
various
races
when
crossed
together
are
quite
fertile
;
yet
in
many
cases
they
are
descended
from
two
or
more
wild
species
.
From
this
fact
we
must
conclude
either
that
the
aboriginal
parent
species
at
first
produced
perfectly
fertile
hybrids
,
or
that
the
hybrids
subsequently
reared
under
domestication
became
quite
fertile
.
This
latter
alternative
,
which
was
first
propounded
by
Pallas
,
seems
by
far
the
most
probable
,
and
can
,
indeed
,
hardly
be
doubted
.
It
is
,
for
instance
,
almost
certain
that
our
dogs
are
descended
from
several
wild
stocks
;
yet
,
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
certain
indigenous
domestic
dogs
of
South
America
,
all
are
quite
fertile
together
;
but
analogy
makes
me
greatly
doubt
whether
the
several
aboriginal
species
would
at
first
have
freely
bred
together
and
have
produced
quite
fertile
hybrids
.
So
again
I
have
lately
acquired
decisive
evidence
that
the
crossed
offspring
from
the
Indian
humped
and
common
cattle
are
inter
se
perfectly
fertile
;
and
from
the
observations
by
Rutimeyer
on
their
important
osteological
differences
,
as
well
as
from
those
by
Mr
.
Blyth
on
their
differences
in
habits
,
voice
,
constitution
,
&c
.
,
these
two
forms
must
be
regarded
as
good
and
distinct
species
.
The
same
remarks
may
be
extended
to
the
two
chief
races
of
the
pig
.
We
must
,
therefore
,
either
give
up
the
belief
of
the
universal
sterility
of
species
when
crossed
;
or
we
must
look
at
this
sterility
in
animals
,
not
as
an
indelible
characteristic
,
but
as
one
capable
of
being
removed
by
domestication
.
Finally
,
considering
all
the
ascertained
facts
on
the
intercrossing
of
plants
and
animals
,
it
may
be
concluded
that
some
degree
of
sterility
,
both
in
first
crosses
and
in
hybrids
,
is
an
extremely
general
result
;
but
that
it
cannot
,
under
our
present
state
of
knowledge
,
be
considered
as
absolutely
universal
.
Laws
governing
the
Sterility
of
first
Crosses
and
of
Hybrids
We
will
now
consider
a
little
more
in
detail
the
laws
governing
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
.
Our
chief
object
will
be
to
see
whether
or
not
these
laws
indicate
that
species
have
been
specially
endowed
with
this
quality
,
in
order
to
prevent
their
crossing
and
blending
together
in
utter
confusion
.
The
following
conclusions
are
drawn
up
chiefly
from
Gartner's
admirable
work
on
the
hybridisation
of
plants
.
I
have
taken
much
pains
to
ascertain
how
far
they
apply
to
animals
,
and
,
considering
how
scanty
our
knowledge
is
in
regard
to
hybrid
animals
,
I
have
been
surprised
to
find
how
generally
the
same
rules
apply
to
both
kingdoms
.
It
has
been
already
remarked
,
that
the
degree
of
fertility
,
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
,
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
.
It
is
surprising
in
how
many
curious
ways
this
gradation
can
be
shown
;
but
only
the
barest
outline
of
the
facts
can
here
be
given
.
When
pollen
from
a
plant
of
one
family
is
placed
on
the
stigma
of
a
plant
of
a
distinct
family
,
it
exerts
no
more
influence
than
so
much
inorganic
dust
.
From
this
absolute
zero
of
fertility
,
the
pollen
of
different
species
applied
to
the
stigma
of
some
one
species
of
the
same
genus
,
yields
a
perfect
gradation
in
the
number
of
seeds
produced
,
up
to
nearly
complete
or
even
quite
complete
fertility
;
and
,
as
we
have
seen
,
in
certain
abnormal
cases
,
even
to
an
excess
of
fertility
,
beyond
that
which
the
plant's
own
pollen
produces
.
So
in
hybrids
themselves
,
there
are
some
which
never
have
produced
,
and
probably
never
would
produce
,
even
with
the
pollen
of
the
pure
parents
,
a
single
fertile
seed
:
but
in
some
of
these
cases
a
first
trace
of
fertility
may
be
detected
,
by
the
pollen
of
one
of
the
pure
parent
species
causing
the
flower
of
the
hybrid
to
wither
earlier
than
it
otherwise
would
have
done
;
and
the
early
withering
of
the
flower
is
well
known
to
be
a
sign
of
incipient
fertilisation
.
From
this
extreme
degree
of
sterility
we
have
self
sterilised
hybrids
producing
a
greater
and
greater
number
of
seeds
up
to
perfect
fertility
.
The
hybrids
raised
from
two
species
which
are
very
difficult
to
cross
,
and
which
rarely
produce
any
offspring
,
are
generally
very
sterile
;
but
the
parallelism
between
the
difficulty
of
making
a
first
cross
,
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
thus
produced
two
classes
of
facts
which
are
generally
confounded
together
is
by
no
means
strict
.
There
are
many
cases
,
in
which
two
pure
species
,
as
in
the
genus
Verbascum
,
can
be
united
with
unusual
facility
,
and
produce
numerous
hybrid
offspring
,
yet
these
hybrids
are
remarkably
sterile
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
species
which
can
be
crossed
very
rarely
,
or
with
extreme
difficulty
,
but
the
hybrids
,
when
at
last
produced
,
are
very
fertile
.
Even
within
the
limits
of
the
same
genus
,
for
instance
in
Dianthus
,
these
two
opposite
cases
occur
.
The
fertility
,
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
,
is
more
easily
affected
by
unfavourable
conditions
,
than
is
that
of
pure
species
.
But
the
fertility
of
first
crosses
is
likewise
innately
variable
;
for
it
is
not
always
the
same
in
degree
when
the
same
two
species
are
crossed
under
the
same
circumstances
;
it
depends
in
part
upon
the
constitution
of
the
individuals
which
happen
to
have
been
chosen
for
the
experiment
.
So
it
is
with
hybrids
,
for
their
degree
of
fertility
is
often
found
to
differ
greatly
in
the
several
individuals
raised
from
seed
out
of
the
same
capsule
and
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
.
By
the
term
systematic
affinity
is
meant
,
the
general
resemblance
between
species
in
structure
and
constitution
.
Now
the
fertility
of
first
crosses
,
and
of
the
hybrids
produced
from
them
,
is
largely
governed
by
their
systematic
affinity
.
This
is
clearly
shown
by
hybrids
never
having
been
raised
between
species
ranked
by
systematists
in
distinct
families
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
by
very
closely
allied
species
generally
uniting
with
facility
.
But
the
correspondence
between
systematic
affinity
and
the
facility
of
crossing
is
by
no
means
strict
.
A
multitude
of
cases
could
be
given
of
very
closely
allied
species
which
will
not
unite
,
or
only
with
extreme
difficulty
;
and
on
the
other
hand
of
very
distinct
species
which
unite
with
the
utmost
facility
.
In
the
same
family
there
may
be
a
genus
,
as
Dianthus
,
in
which
very
many
species
can
most
readily
be
crossed
;
and
another
genus
,
as
Silene
,
in
which
the
most
persevering
efforts
have
failed
to
produce
between
extremely
close
species
a
single
hybrid
.
Even
within
the
limits
of
the
same
genus
,
we
meet
with
this
same
difference
;
for
instance
,
the
many
species
of
Nicotiana
have
been
more
largely
crossed
than
the
species
of
almost
any
other
genus
;
but
Gartner
found
that
N
.
acuminata
,
which
is
not
a
particularly
distinct
species
,
obstinately
failed
to
fertilise
,
or
to
be
fertilised
by
no
less
than
eight
other
species
of
Nicotiana
.
Many
analogous
facts
could
be
given
.
No
one
has
been
able
to
point
out
what
kind
or
what
amount
of
difference
,
in
any
recognisable
character
,
is
sufficient
to
prevent
two
species
crossing
.
It
can
be
shown
that
plants
most
widely
different
in
habit
and
general
appearance
,
and
having
strongly
marked
differences
in
every
part
of
the
flower
,
even
in
the
pollen
,
in
the
fruit
,
and
in
the
cotyledons
,
can
be
crossed
.
Annual
and
perennial
plants
,
deciduous
and
evergreen
trees
,
plants
inhabiting
different
stations
and
fitted
for
extremely
different
climates
,
can
often
be
crossed
with
ease
.
By
a
reciprocal
cross
between
two
species
,
I
mean
the
case
,
for
instance
,
of
a
female
ass
being
first
crossed
by
a
stallion
,
and
then
a
mare
by
a
male
ass
;
these
two
species
may
then
be
said
to
have
been
reciprocally
crossed
.
There
is
often
the
widest
possible
difference
in
the
facility
of
making
reciprocal
crosses
.
Such
cases
are
highly
important
,
for
they
prove
that
the
capacity
in
any
two
species
to
cross
is
often
completely
independent
of
their
systematic
affinity
,
that
is
of
any
difference
in
their
structure
or
constitution
,
excepting
in
their
reproductive
systems
.
The
diversity
of
the
result
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
was
long
ago
observed
by
Kolreuter
.
To
give
an
instance
:
Mirabilis
jalapa
can
easily
be
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
M
.
longiflora
,
and
the
hybrids
thus
produced
are
sufficiently
fertile
;
but
Kolreuter
tried
more
than
two
hundred
times
,
during
eight
following
years
,
to
fertilise
reciprocally
M
.
longiflora
with
the
pollen
of
M
.
jalapa
,
and
utterly
failed
.
Several
other
equally
striking
cases
could
be
given
.
Thuret
has
observed
the
same
fact
with
certain
sea
weeds
or
Fuci
.
Gartner
,
moreover
,
found
that
this
difference
of
facility
in
making
reciprocal
crosses
is
extremely
common
in
a
lesser
degree
.
He
has
observed
it
even
between
closely
related
forms
(
as
Matthiola
annua
and
gilabra
)
which
many
botanists
rank
only
as
varieties
.
It
is
also
a
remarkable
fact
,
that
hybrids
raised
from
reciprocal
crosses
,
though
of
course
compounded
of
the
very
same
two
species
,
the
one
species
having
first
been
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
,
though
they
rarely
differ
in
external
characters
,
yet
generally
differ
in
fertility
in
a
small
,
and
occasionally
in
a
high
degree
.
Several
other
singular
rules
could
be
given
from
Gartner
:
for
instance
,
some
species
have
a
remarkable
power
of
crossing
with
other
species
;
other
species
of
the
same
genus
have
a
remarkable
power
of
impressing
their
likeness
on
their
hybrid
offspring
;
but
these
two
powers
do
not
at
all
necessarily
go
together
.
There
are
certain
hybrids
which
,
instead
of
having
,
as
is
usual
,
an
intermediate
character
between
their
two
parents
,
always
closely
resemble
one
of
them
;
and
such
hybrids
,
though
externally
so
like
one
of
their
pure
parent
species
,
are
with
rare
exceptions
extremely
sterile
.
So
again
amongst
hybrids
which
are
usually
intermediate
in
structure
between
their
parents
,
exceptional
and
abnormal
individuals
sometimes
are
born
,
which
closely
resemble
one
of
their
pure
parents
;
and
these
hybrids
are
almost
always
utterly
sterile
,
even
when
the
other
hybrids
raised
from
seed
from
the
same
capsule
have
a
considerable
degree
of
fertility
.
These
facts
show
how
completely
the
fertility
of
a
hybrid
may
be
independent
of
its
external
resemblance
to
either
pure
parent
.
Considering
the
several
rules
now
given
,
which
govern
the
fertility
of
first
causes
and
of
hybrids
,
we
see
that
when
forms
,
which
must
be
considered
as
good
and
distinct
species
,
are
united
,
their
fertility
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
,
or
even
to
fertility
under
certain
conditions
in
excess
;
that
their
fertility
,
besides
being
eminently
susceptible
to
favourable
and
unfavourable
conditions
,
is
innately
variable
;
that
it
is
by
no
means
always
the
same
in
degree
in
the
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrids
produced
from
this
cross
;
that
the
fertility
of
hybrids
is
not
related
to
the
degree
in
which
they
resemble
in
external
appearance
either
parent
;
and
lastly
,
that
the
facility
of
making
a
first
cross
between
any
two
species
is
not
always
governed
by
their
systematic
affinity
or
degree
of
resemblance
to
each
other
.
This
latter
statement
is
clearly
proved
by
the
difference
in
the
result
of
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
,
for
,
according
as
the
one
species
or
the
other
is
used
as
the
father
or
the
mother
,
there
is
generally
some
difference
,
and
occasionally
the
widest
possible
difference
,
in
the
facility
of
effecting
an
union
.
The
hybrids
,
moreover
,
produced
from
reciprocal
crosses
often
differ
in
fertility
.
Now
do
these
complex
and
singular
rules
indicate
that
species
have
been
endowed
with
sterility
simply
to
prevent
their
becoming
confounded
in
nature
?
I
think
not
.
For
why
should
the
sterility
be
so
extremely
different
in
degree
,
when
various
species
are
crossed
,
all
of
which
we
must
suppose
it
would
be
equally
important
to
keep
from
blending
together
?
Why
should
the
degree
of
sterility
be
innately
variable
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
?
Why
should
some
species
cross
with
facility
,
and
yet
produce
very
sterile
hybrids
;
and
other
species
cross
with
extreme
difficulty
,
and
yet
produce
fairly
fertile
hybrids
?
Why
should
there
often
be
so
great
a
difference
in
the
result
of
a
reciprocal
cross
between
the
same
two
species
?
Why
,
it
may
even
be
asked
,
has
the
production
of
hybrids
been
permitted
?
To
grant
to
species
the
special
power
of
producing
hybrids
,
and
then
to
stop
their
further
propagation
by
different
degrees
of
sterility
,
not
strictly
related
to
the
facility
of
the
first
union
between
their
parents
,
seems
a
strange
arrangement
.
The
foregoing
rules
and
facts
,
on
the
other
hand
,
appear
to
me
clearly
to
indicate
that
the
sterility
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
is
simply
incidental
or
dependent
on
unknown
differences
in
their
reproductive
systems
;
the
differences
being
of
so
peculiar
and
limited
a
nature
,
that
,
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
,
the
male
sexual
element
of
the
one
will
often
freely
act
on
the
female
sexual
element
of
the
other
,
but
not
in
a
reversed
direction
.
It
will
be
advisable
to
explain
a
little
more
fully
by
an
example
what
I
mean
by
sterility
being
incidental
on
other
differences
,
and
not
a
specially
endowed
quality
.
As
the
capacity
of
one
plant
to
be
grafted
or
budded
on
another
is
unimportant
for
their
welfare
in
a
state
of
nature
,
I
presume
that
no
one
will
suppose
that
this
capacity
is
a
specially
endowed
quality
,
but
will
admit
that
it
is
incidental
on
differences
in
the
laws
of
growth
of
the
two
plants
.
We
can
sometimes
see
the
reason
why
one
tree
will
not
take
on
another
,
from
differences
in
their
rate
of
growth
,
in
the
hardness
of
their
wood
,
in
the
period
of
the
flow
or
nature
of
their
sap
,
&c
.
;
but
in
a
multitude
of
cases
we
can
assign
no
reason
whatever
.
Great
diversity
in
the
size
of
two
plants
,
one
being
woody
and
the
other
herbaceous
,
one
being
evergreen
and
the
other
deciduous
,
and
adaptation
to
widely
different
climates
,
do
not
always
prevent
the
two
grafting
together
.
As
in
hybridisation
,
so
with
grafting
,
the
capacity
is
limited
by
systematic
affinity
,
for
no
one
has
been
able
to
graft
together
trees
belonging
to
quite
distinct
families
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
closely
allied
species
,
and
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
can
usually
,
but
not
invariably
,
be
grafted
with
ease
.
But
this
capacity
,
as
in
hybridisation
,
is
by
no
means
absolutely
governed
by
systematic
affinity
.
Although
many
distinct
genera
within
the
same
family
have
been
grafted
together
,
in
other
cases
species
of
the
same
genus
will
not
take
on
each
other
.
The
pear
can
be
grafted
far
more
readily
on
the
quince
,
which
is
ranked
as
a
distinct
genus
,
than
on
the
apple
,
which
is
a
member
of
the
same
genus
.
Even
different
varieties
of
the
pear
take
with
different
degrees
of
facility
on
the
quince
;
so
do
different
varieties
of
the
apricot
and
peach
on
certain
varieties
of
the
plum
.
As
Gartner
found
that
there
was
sometimes
an
innate
difference
in
different
individuals
of
the
same
two
species
in
crossing
;
so
Sageret
believes
this
to
be
the
case
with
different
individuals
of
the
same
two
species
in
being
grafted
together
.
As
in
reciprocal
crosses
,
the
facility
of
effecting
an
union
is
often
very
far
from
equal
,
so
it
sometimes
is
in
grafting
;
the
common
gooseberry
,
for
instance
,
cannot
be
grafted
on
the
currant
,
whereas
the
current
will
take
,
though
with
difficulty
,
on
the
gooseberry
.
We
have
seen
that
the
sterility
of
hybrids
,
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
in
an
imperfect
condition
,
is
a
different
case
from
the
difficulty
of
uniting
two
pure
species
,
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
perfect
;
yet
these
two
distinct
classes
of
cases
run
to
a
large
extent
parallel
.
Something
analogous
occurs
in
grafting
;
for
Thouin
found
that
three
species
of
Robinia
,
which
seeded
freely
on
their
own
roots
,
and
which
could
be
grafted
with
no
great
difficulty
on
a
fourth
species
,
when
thus
grafted
were
rendered
barren
.
On
the
other
hand
,
certain
species
of
Sorbus
,
when
grafted
on
other
species
yielded
twice
as
much
fruit
as
when
on
their
own
roots
.
We
are
reminded
by
this
latter
fact
of
the
extraordinary
cases
of
Hippeastrum
,
Passiflora
,
&c
.
,
which
seed
much
more
freely
when
fertilised
with
the
pollen
of
a
distinct
species
,
than
when
fertilised
with
pollen
from
the
same
plant
.
We
thus
see
,
that
,
although
there
is
a
clear
and
great
difference
between
the
mere
adhesion
of
grafted
stocks
,
and
the
union
of
the
male
and
female
elements
in
the
act
of
reproduction
,
yet
that
there
is
a
rude
degree
of
parallelism
in
the
results
of
grafting
and
of
crossing
distinct
species
.
And
as
we
must
look
at
the
curious
and
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
with
which
trees
can
be
grafted
on
each
other
as
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
vegetative
systems
,
so
I
believe
that
the
still
more
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
of
first
crosses
are
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
reproductive
systems
.
These
differences
in
both
cases
,
follow
to
a
certain
extent
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
systematic
affinity
,
by
which
term
every
kind
of
resemblance
and
dissimilarity
between
organic
beings
is
attempted
to
be
expressed
.
The
facts
by
no
means
seem
to
indicate
that
the
greater
or
lesser
difficulty
of
either
grafting
or
crossing
various
species
has
been
a
special
endowment
;
although
in
the
case
of
crossing
,
the
difficulty
is
as
important
for
the
endurance
and
stability
of
specific
forms
,
as
in
the
case
of
grafting
it
is
unimportant
for
their
welfare
.
Origin
and
Causes
of
the
Sterility
of
first
Crosses
and
of
Hybrids
At
one
time
it
appeared
to
me
probable
,
as
it
has
to
others
,
that
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
might
have
been
slowly
acquired
through
the
natural
selection
of
slightly
lessened
degrees
of
fertility
,
which
,
like
any
other
variation
,
spontaneously
appeared
in
certain
individuals
of
one
variety
when
crossed
with
those
of
another
variety
.
For
it
would
clearly
be
advantageous
to
two
varieties
or
incipient
species
,
if
they
could
be
kept
from
blending
,
on
the
same
principle
that
,
when
man
is
selecting
at
the
same
time
two
varieties
,
it
is
necessary
that
he
should
keep
them
separate
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
may
be
remarked
that
species
inhabiting
distinct
regions
are
often
sterile
when
crossed
;
now
it
could
clearly
have
been
of
no
advantage
to
such
separated
species
to
have
been
rendered
mutually
sterile
,
and
consequently
this
could
not
have
been
effected
through
natural
selection
;
but
it
may
perhaps
be
argued
,
that
,
if
a
species
was
rendered
sterile
with
some
one
compatriot
,
sterility
with
other
species
would
follow
as
a
necessary
contingency
.
In
the
second
place
,
it
is
almost
as
much
opposed
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
as
to
that
of
special
creation
,
that
in
reciprocal
crosses
the
male
element
of
one
form
should
have
been
rendered
utterly
impotent
on
a
second
form
,
whilst
at
the
same
time
the
male
element
of
this
second
form
is
enabled
freely
to
fertilise
the
first
form
;
for
this
peculiar
state
of
the
reproductive
system
could
hardly
have
been
advantageous
to
either
species
.
In
considering
the
probability
of
natural
selection
having
come
into
action
,
in
rendering
species
mutually
sterile
,
the
greatest
difficulty
will
be
found
to
lie
in
the
existence
of
many
graduated
steps
from
slightly
lessened
fertility
to
absolute
sterility
.
It
may
be
admitted
that
it
would
profit
an
incipient
species
,
if
it
were
rendered
in
some
slight
degree
sterile
when
crossed
with
its
parent
form
or
with
some
other
variety
;
for
thus
fewer
bastardised
and
deteriorated
offspring
would
be
produced
to
commingle
their
blood
with
the
new
species
in
process
of
formation
.
But
he
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
reflect
on
the
steps
by
which
this
first
degree
of
sterility
could
be
increased
through
natural
selection
to
that
high
degree
which
is
common
with
so
many
species
,
and
which
is
universal
with
species
which
have
been
differentiated
to
a
generic
or
family
rank
,
will
find
the
subject
extraordinarily
complex
.
After
mature
reflection
it
seems
to
me
that
this
could
not
have
been
effected
through
natural
selection
.
Take
the
case
of
any
two
species
which
,
when
crossed
,
produced
few
and
sterile
offspring
;
now
,
what
is
there
which
could
favour
the
survival
of
those
individuals
which
happened
to
be
endowed
in
a
slightly
higher
degree
with
mutual
infertility
,
and
which
thus
approached
by
one
small
step
towards
absolute
sterility
?
Yet
an
advance
of
this
kind
,
if
the
theory
of
natural
selection
be
brought
to
bear
,
must
have
incessantly
occurred
with
many
species
,
for
a
multitude
are
mutually
quite
barren
.
With
sterile
neuter
insects
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
modifications
in
their
structure
and
fertility
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
natural
selection
,
from
an
advantage
having
been
thus
indirectly
given
to
the
community
to
which
they
belonged
over
other
communities
of
the
same
species
;
but
an
individual
animal
not
belonging
to
a
social
community
,
if
rendered
slightly
sterile
when
crossed
with
some
other
variety
,
would
not
thus
itself
gain
any
advantage
or
indirectly
give
any
advantage
to
the
other
individuals
of
the
same
variety
,
thus
leading
to
their
preservation
.
But
it
would
be
superfluous
to
discuss
this
question
in
detail
;
for
with
plants
we
have
conclusive
evidence
that
the
sterility
of
crossed
species
must
be
due
to
some
principle
,
quite
independent
of
natural
selection
.
Both
Gartner
and
Kolreuter
have
proved
that
in
genera
including
numerous
species
,
a
series
can
be
formed
from
species
which
when
crossed
yield
fewer
and
fewer
seeds
,
to
species
which
never
produce
a
single
seed
,
but
yet
are
affected
by
the
pollen
of
certain
other
species
,
for
the
germen
swells
.
It
is
here
manifestly
impossible
to
select
the
more
sterile
individuals
,
which
have
already
ceased
to
yield
seeds
;
so
that
this
acme
of
sterility
,
when
the
germen
alone
is
affected
,
cannot
have
been
gained
through
selection
;
and
from
the
laws
governing
the
various
grades
of
sterility
being
so
uniform
throughout
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
,
we
may
infer
that
the
cause
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
is
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
in
an
cases
.
We
will
now
look
a
little
closer
at
the
probable
nature
of
the
differences
between
species
which
induce
sterility
in
first
crosses
and
in
hybrids
.
In
the
case
of
first
crosses
,
the
greater
or
less
difficulty
in
effecting
an
union
and
in
obtaining
offspring
apparently
depends
on
several
distinct
causes
.
There
must
sometimes
be
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
male
element
reaching
the
ovule
,
as
would
be
the
case
with
a
plant
having
a
pistil
too
long
for
the
pollen
tubes
to
reach
the
ovarium
.
It
has
also
been
observed
that
when
the
pollen
of
one
species
is
placed
on
the
stigma
of
a
distantly
allied
species
,
though
the
pollen
tubes
protrude
,
they
do
not
penetrate
the
stigmatic
surface
.
Again
,
the
male
element
may
reach
the
female
element
but
be
incapable
of
causing
an
embryo
to
be
developed
,
as
seems
to
have
been
the
case
with
some
of
Thuret's
experiments
on
Fuci
.
No
explanation
can
be
given
of
these
facts
,
any
more
than
why
certain
trees
cannot
be
grafted
on
others
.
Lastly
,
an
embryo
may
be
developed
,
and
then
perish
at
an
early
period
.
This
latter
alternative
has
not
been
sufficiently
attended
to
;
but
I
believe
,
from
observations
communicated
to
me
by
Mr
.
Rewitt
,
who
has
had
great
experience
in
hybridising
pheasants
and
fowls
,
that
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
is
a
very
frequent
cause
of
sterility
in
first
crosses
.
Mr
.
Salter
has
recently
given
the
results
of
an
examination
of
about
500
eggs
produced
from
various
crosses
between
three
species
of
Gallus
and
their
hybrids
;
the
majority
of
these
eggs
had
been
fertilised
;
and
in
the
majority
of
the
fertilised
eggs
,
the
embryos
had
either
been
partially
developed
and
had
then
perished
,
or
had
become
nearly
mature
,
but
the
young
chickens
had
been
unable
to
break
through
the
shell
.
Of
the
chickens
which
were
born
,
more
than
four
fifths
died
within
the
first
few
days
,
or
at
latest
weeks
,
"
without
any
obvious
cause
,
apparently
from
mere
inability
to
live
"
;
so
that
from
the
500
eggs
only
twelve
chickens
were
reared
.
With
plants
,
hybridised
embryos
probably
often
perish
in
a
like
manner
;
at
least
it
is
known
that
hybrids
raised
from
very
distinct
species
are
sometimes
weak
and
dwarfed
,
and
perish
at
an
early
age
;
of
which
fact
Max
Wichura
has
recently
given
some
striking
cases
with
hybrid
willows
.
It
may
be
here
worth
noticing
that
in
some
cases
of
parthenogenesis
,
the
embryos
within
the
eggs
of
silk
moths
which
had
not
been
fertilised
,
pass
through
their
early
stages
of
development
and
then
perish
like
the
embryos
produced
by
a
cross
between
distinct
species
.
Until
becoming
acquainted
with
these
facts
,
I
was
unwilling
to
believe
in
the
frequent
early
death
of
hybrid
embryos
;
for
hybrids
,
when
once
born
,
are
generally
healthy
and
long
lived
,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
the
common
mule
.
Hybrids
,
however
,
are
differently
circumstanced
before
and
after
birth
:
when
born
and
living
in
a
country
where
their
two
parents
live
,
they
are
generally
placed
under
suitable
conditions
of
life
.
But
a
hybrid
partakes
of
only
half
of
the
nature
and
constitution
of
its
mother
;
it
may
therefore
before
birth
,
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
within
its
mother's
womb
,
or
within
the
egg
or
seed
produced
by
the
mother
,
be
exposed
to
conditions
in
some
degree
unsuitable
,
and
consequently
be
liable
to
perish
at
an
early
period
;
more
especially
as
all
very
young
beings
are
eminently
sensitive
to
injurious
or
unnatural
conditions
of
life
.
But
after
all
,
the
cause
more
probably
lies
in
some
imperfection
in
the
original
act
of
impregnation
,
causing
the
embryo
to
be
imperfectly
developed
,
rather
than
in
the
conditions
to
which
it
is
subsequently
exposed
.
In
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
,
in
which
the
sexual
elements
are
imperfectly
developed
,
the
case
is
somewhat
different
.
I
have
more
than
once
alluded
to
a
large
body
of
facts
showing
that
,
when
animals
and
plants
are
removed
from
their
natural
conditions
,
they
are
extremely
liable
to
have
their
reproductive
systems
seriously
affected
.
This
,
in
fact
,
is
the
great
bar
to
the
domestication
of
animals
.
Between
the
sterility
thus
super
induced
and
that
of
hybrids
,
there
are
many
points
of
similarity
.
In
both
cases
the
sterility
is
independent
of
general
health
,
and
is
often
accompanied
by
excess
of
size
or
great
luxuriance
.
In
both
cases
the
sterility
occurs
in
various
degrees
;
in
both
,
the
male
element
is
the
most
liable
to
be
affected
;
but
sometimes
the
female
more
than
the
male
.
In
both
,
the
tendency
goes
to
a
certain
extent
with
systematic
affinity
,
for
whole
groups
of
animals
and
plants
are
rendered
impotent
by
the
same
unnatural
conditions
;
and
whole
groups
of
species
tend
to
produce
sterile
hybrids
.
On
the
other
hand
,
one
species
in
a
group
will
sometimes
resist
great
changes
of
conditions
with
unimpaired
fertility
;
and
certain
species
in
a
group
will
produce
unusually
fertile
hybrids
.
No
one
can
tell
,
till
he
tries
,
whether
any
particular
animal
will
breed
under
confinement
,
or
any
exotic
plant
seed
freely
under
culture
;
nor
can
he
tell
till
he
tries
,
whether
any
two
species
of
a
genus
will
produce
more
or
less
sterile
hybrids
.
Lastly
,
when
organic
beings
are
placed
during
several
generations
under
conditions
not
natural
to
them
,
they
are
extremely
liable
to
vary
,
which
seems
to
be
partly
due
to
their
reproductive
systems
having
been
specially
affected
,
though
in
a
lesser
degree
than
when
sterility
ensues
.
So
it
is
with
hybrids
,
for
their
offspring
in
successive
generations
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
,
as
every
experimentalist
has
observed
.
Thus
we
see
that
when
organic
beings
are
placed
under
new
and
unnatural
conditions
,
and
when
hybrids
are
produced
by
the
unnatural
crossing
of
two
species
,
the
reproductive
system
,
independently
of
the
general
state
of
health
,
is
affected
in
a
very
similar
manner
.
In
the
one
case
,
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
disturbed
,
though
often
in
so
slight
a
degree
as
to
be
inappreciable
by
us
;
in
the
other
case
,
or
that
of
hybrids
,
the
external
conditions
have
remained
the
same
,
but
the
organisation
has
been
disturbed
by
two
distinct
structures
and
constitutions
,
including
of
course
the
reproductive
systems
,
having
been
blended
into
one
.
For
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
two
organisations
should
be
compounded
into
one
,
without
some
disturbance
occurring
in
the
development
,
or
periodical
action
,
or
mutual
relations
of
the
different
parts
and
organs
one
to
another
or
to
the
conditions
of
life
.
When
hybrids
are
able
to
breed
inter
se
,
they
transmit
to
their
offspring
from
generation
to
generation
the
same
compounded
organisation
,
and
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
their
sterility
,
though
in
some
degree
variable
,
does
not
diminish
;
it
is
even
apt
to
increase
,
this
being
generally
the
result
,
as
before
explained
,
of
too
close
interbreeding
.
The
above
view
of
the
sterility
of
hybrids
being
caused
by
two
constitutions
being
compounded
into
one
has
been
strongly
maintained
by
Max
Wichura
.
It
must
,
however
,
be
owned
that
we
cannot
understand
,
on
the
above
or
any
other
view
,
several
facts
with
respect
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
;
for
instance
,
the
unequal
fertility
of
hybrids
produced
from
reciprocal
crosses
;
or
the
increased
sterility
in
those
hybrids
which
occasionally
and
exceptionally
resemble
closely
either
pure
parent
.
Nor
do
I
pretend
that
the
foregoing
remarks
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
;
no
explanation
is
offered
why
an
organism
,
when
placed
under
unnatural
conditions
,
is
rendered
sterile
.
All
that
I
have
attempted
to
show
is
,
that
in
two
cases
,
in
some
respects
allied
,
sterility
is
the
common
result
,
in
the
one
case
from
the
conditions
of
life
having
been
disturbed
,
in
the
other
case
from
the
organisation
having
been
disturbed
by
two
organisations
being
compounded
into
one
.
A
similar
parallelism
holds
good
with
an
allied
yet
very
different
class
of
facts
.
It
is
an
old
and
almost
universal
belief
founded
on
a
considerable
body
of
evidence
,
which
I
have
elsewhere
given
,
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
are
beneficial
to
all
living
things
.
We
see
this
acted
on
by
farmers
and
gardeners
in
their
frequent
exchanges
of
seed
,
tubers
,
&c
.
,
from
one
soil
or
climate
to
another
,
and
back
again
.
During
the
convalescence
of
animals
,
great
benefit
is
derived
from
almost
any
change
in
their
habits
of
life
.
Again
,
both
with
plants
and
animals
,
there
is
the
clearest
evidence
that
a
cross
between
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
which
differ
to
a
certain
extent
,
gives
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
;
and
that
close
interbreeding
continued
during
several
generations
between
the
nearest
relations
,
if
these
be
kept
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
,
almost
always
leads
to
decreased
size
,
weakness
,
or
sterility
.
Hence
it
seems
that
,
on
the
one
hand
,
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
benefit
all
organic
beings
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
that
slight
crosses
,
that
is
crosses
between
the
males
and
females
of
the
same
species
,
which
have
been
subjected
to
slightly
different
conditions
,
or
which
have
slightly
varied
,
give
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
.
But
,
as
we
have
seen
,
organic
beings
long
habituated
to
certain
uniform
conditions
under
a
state
of
nature
,
when
subjected
,
as
under
confinement
,
to
a
considerable
change
in
their
conditions
,
very
frequently
are
rendered
more
or
less
sterile
;
and
we
know
that
a
cross
between
two
forms
,
that
have
become
widely
or
specifically
different
,
produce
hybrids
which
are
almost
always
in
some
degree
sterile
.
I
am
fully
persuaded
that
this
double
parallelism
is
by
no
means
an
accident
or
an
illusion
.
He
who
is
able
to
explain
why
the
elephant
and
a
multitude
of
other
animals
are
incapable
of
breeding
when
kept
under
only
partial
confinement
in
their
native
country
,
will
be
able
to
explain
the
primary
cause
of
hybrids
being
so
generally
sterile
.
He
will
at
the
same
time
be
able
to
explain
how
it
is
that
the
races
of
some
of
our
domesticated
animals
,
which
have
often
been
subjected
to
new
and
not
uniform
conditions
,
are
quite
fertile
together
,
although
they
are
descended
from
distinct
species
,
which
would
probably
have
been
sterile
if
aboriginally
crossed
.
The
above
two
parallel
series
of
facts
seem
to
be
connected
together
by
some
common
but
unknown
bond
,
which
is
essentially
related
to
the
principle
of
life
;
this
principle
,
according
to
Mr
.
Herbert
Spencer
,
being
that
life
depends
on
,
or
consists
in
,
the
incessant
action
and
reaction
of
various
forces
,
which
,
as
throughout
nature
,
are
always
tending
towards
an
equilibrium
;
and
when
this
tendency
is
slightly
disturbed
by
any
change
,
the
vital
forces
gain
in
power
.
Reciprocal
Dimorphism
and
Trimorphism
This
subject
may
be
here
briefly
discussed
,
and
will
be
found
to
throw
some
light
on
hybridism
.
Several
plants
belonging
to
distinct
orders
present
two
forms
,
which
exist
in
about
equal
numbers
and
which
differ
in
no
respect
except
in
their
reproductive
organs
;
one
form
having
a
long
pistil
with
short
stamens
,
the
other
a
short
pistil
with
long
stamens
;
the
two
having
differently
sized
pollen
grains
.
With
trimorphic
plants
there
are
three
forms
likewise
differing
in
the
lengths
of
the
pistils
and
stamens
,
in
the
size
and
colour
of
the
pollen
grains
,
and
in
some
other
respects
;
and
as
in
each
of
the
three
forms
there
are
two
sets
of
stamens
,
the
three
forms
possess
altogether
six
sets
of
stamens
and
three
kinds
of
pistils
.
These
organs
are
so
proportioned
in
length
to
each
other
,
that
half
the
stamens
in
two
of
the
forms
stand
on
a
level
with
the
stigma
of
the
third
form
.
Now
I
have
shown
,
and
the
result
has
been
confirmed
by
other
observers
,
that
,
in
order
to
obtain
full
fertility
with
these
plants
,
it
is
necessary
that
the
stigma
of
the
one
form
should
be
fertilised
by
pollen
taken
from
the
stamens
of
corresponding
height
in
another
form
.
So
that
with
dimorphic
species
two
unions
,
which
may
be
called
legitimate
,
are
fully
fertile
;
and
two
,
which
may
be
called
illegitimate
,
are
more
or
less
infertile
.
With
trimorphic
species
six
unions
are
legitimate
,
or
fully
fertile
,
and
twelve
are
illegitimate
,
or
more
or
less
infertile
.
The
infertility
which
may
be
observed
in
various
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
,
when
they
are
illegitimately
fertilised
,
that
is
by
pollen
taken
from
stamens
not
corresponding
in
height
with
the
pistil
,
differs
much
in
degree
,
up
to
absolute
and
utter
sterility
;
just
in
the
same
manner
as
occurs
in
crossing
distinct
species
.
As
the
degree
of
sterility
in
the
latter
case
depends
in
an
eminent
degree
on
the
conditions
of
life
being
more
or
less
favourable
,
so
I
have
found
it
with
illegitimate
unions
.
It
is
well
known
that
if
pollen
of
a
distinct
species
be
placed
on
the
stigma
of
a
flower
,
and
its
own
pollen
be
afterwards
,
even
after
a
considerable
interval
of
time
,
placed
on
the
same
stigma
,
its
action
is
so
strongly
prepotent
that
it
generally
annihilates
the
effect
of
the
foreign
pollen
;
so
it
is
with
the
pollen
of
the
several
forms
of
the
same
species
,
for
legitimate
pollen
is
strongly
prepotent
over
illegitimate
pollen
,
when
both
are
placed
on
the
same
stigma
.
I
ascertained
this
by
fertilising
several
flowers
,
first
illegitimately
,
and
twenty
four
hours
afterwards
legitimately
with
the
pollen
taken
from
a
peculiarly
coloured
variety
,
and
all
the
seedlings
were
similarly
coloured
;
this
shows
that
the
legitimate
pollen
,
though
applied
twenty
four
hours
subsequently
,
had
wholly
destroyed
or
prevented
the
action
of
the
previously
applied
illegitimate
pollen
.
Again
,
as
in
making
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
,
there
is
occasionally
a
great
difference
in
the
result
,
so
the
same
thing
occurs
with
trimorphic
plants
;
for
instance
,
the
mid
styled
form
of
Lythrum
galicaria
was
illegitimately
fertilised
with
the
greatest
ease
by
pollen
from
the
longer
stamens
of
the
short
styled
form
,
and
yielded
many
seeds
;
but
the
latter
form
did
not
yield
a
single
seed
when
fertilised
by
the
longer
stamens
of
the
mid
styled
form
.
In
all
these
respects
,
and
in
others
which
might
be
added
,
the
forms
of
the
same
undoubted
species
when
illegitimately
united
behave
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
do
two
distinct
species
when
crossed
.
This
led
me
carefully
to
observe
during
four
years
many
seedlings
,
raised
from
several
illegitimate
unions
.
The
chief
result
is
that
these
illegitimate
plants
,
as
they
may
be
called
,
are
not
fully
fertile
.
It
is
possible
to
raise
from
dimorphic
species
,
both
long
styled
and
short
styled
illegitimate
plants
,
and
from
trimorphic
plants
all
three
illegitimate
forms
.
These
can
then
be
properly
united
in
a
legitimate
manner
.
When
this
is
done
,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
they
should
not
yield
as
many
seeds
as
did
their
parents
when
legitimately
fertilised
.
But
such
is
not
the
case
.
They
are
all
infertile
,
in
various
degrees
;
some
being
so
utterly
and
incurably
sterile
that
they
did
not
yield
during
four
seasons
a
single
seed
or
even
seed
capsule
.
The
sterility
of
these
illegitimate
plants
,
when
united
with
each
other
in
a
legitimate
manner
,
may
be
strictly
compared
with
that
of
hybrids
when
crossed
inter
se
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
a
hybrid
is
crossed
with
either
pure
parent
species
,
the
sterility
is
usually
much
lessened
:
and
so
it
is
when
an
illegitimate
plant
is
fertilised
by
a
legitimate
plant
.
In
the
same
manner
as
the
sterility
of
hybrids
does
not
always
run
parallel
with
the
difficulty
of
making
the
first
cross
between
the
two
parent
species
,
so
the
sterility
of
certain
illegitimate
plants
was
unusually
great
,
whilst
the
sterility
of
the
union
from
which
they
were
derived
was
by
no
means
great
.
With
hybrids
raised
from
the
same
seed
capsule
the
degree
of
sterility
is
innately
variable
,
so
it
is
in
a
marked
manner
with
illegitimate
plants
.
Lastly
,
many
hybrids
are
profuse
and
persistent
flowerers
,
whilst
other
and
more
sterile
hybrids
produce
few
flowers
,
and
are
weak
,
miserable
dwarfs
;
exactly
similar
cases
occur
with
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
various
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
.
Altogether
there
is
the
closest
identity
in
character
and
behaviour
between
illegitimate
plants
and
hybrids
.
It
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
maintain
that
illegitimate
plants
are
hybrids
,
produced
within
the
limits
of
the
same
species
by
the
improper
union
of
certain
forms
,
whilst
ordinary
hybrids
are
produced
from
an
improper
union
between
so
called
distinct
species
.
We
have
also
already
seen
that
there
is
the
closest
similarity
in
all
respects
between
first
illegitimate
unions
and
first
crosses
between
distinct
species
.
This
will
perhaps
be
made
more
fully
apparent
by
an
illustration
;
we
may
suppose
that
a
botanist
found
two
well
marked
varieties
(
and
such
occur
)
of
the
long
styled
form
of
the
trimorphic
Lythrum
salicaria
,
and
that
he
determined
to
try
by
crossing
whether
they
were
specifically
distinct
.
He
would
find
that
they
yielded
only
about
one
fifth
of
the
proper
number
of
seeds
,
and
that
they
behaved
in
all
the
other
above
specified
respects
as
if
they
had
been
two
distinct
species
.
But
to
make
the
case
sure
,
he
would
raise
plants
from
his
supposed
hybridised
seed
,
and
he
would
find
that
the
seedlings
were
miserably
dwarfed
and
utterly
sterile
,
and
that
they
behaved
in
all
other
respects
like
ordinary
hybrids
.
He
might
then
maintain
that
he
had
actually
proved
,
in
accordance
with
the
common
view
,
that
his
two
varieties
were
as
good
and
as
distinct
species
as
any
in
the
world
;
but
he
would
be
completely
mistaken
.
The
facts
now
given
on
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
are
important
,
because
they
show
us
,
first
,
that
the
physiological
test
of
lessened
fertility
,
both
in
first
crosses
and
in
hybrids
,
is
no
safe
criterion
of
specific
distinction
;
secondly
,
because
we
may
conclude
that
there
is
some
unknown
bond
which
connects
the
infertility
of
illegitimate
unions
with
that
of
their
illegitimate
offspring
,
and
we
are
led
to
extend
the
same
view
to
first
crosses
and
hybrids
;
thirdly
,
because
we
find
,
and
this
seems
to
me
of
especial
importance
,
that
two
or
three
forms
of
the
same
species
may
exist
and
may
differ
in
no
respect
whatever
,
either
in
structure
or
in
constitution
,
relatively
to
external
conditions
,
and
yet
be
sterile
when
united
in
certain
ways
.
For
we
must
remember
that
it
is
the
union
of
the
sexual
elements
of
individuals
of
the
same
form
,
for
instance
,
of
two
long
styled
forms
,
which
results
in
sterility
;
whilst
it
is
the
union
of
the
sexual
elements
proper
to
two
distinct
forms
which
is
fertile
.
Hence
the
case
appears
at
first
sight
exactly
the
reverse
of
what
occurs
,
in
the
ordinary
unions
of
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
and
with
crosses
between
distinct
species
.
It
is
,
however
,
doubtful
whether
this
is
really
so
;
but
I
will
not
enlarge
on
this
obscure
subject
.
We
may
,
however
,
infer
as
probable
from
the
consideration
of
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
,
that
the
sterility
of
distinct
species
when
crossed
and
of
their
hybrid
progeny
,
depends
exclusively
on
the
nature
of
their
sexual
elements
,
and
not
on
any
difference
in
their
structure
or
general
constitution
.
We
are
also
led
to
this
same
conclusion
by
considering
reciprocal
crosses
,
in
which
the
male
of
one
species
cannot
be
united
,
or
can
be
united
with
great
difficulty
,
with
the
female
of
a
second
species
,
whilst
the
converse
cross
can
be
effected
with
perfect
facility
.
That
excellent
observer
,
Gartner
,
likewise
concluded
that
species
when
crossed
are
sterile
owing
to
differences
confined
to
their
reproductive
systems
.
Fertility
of
Varieties
when
Crossed
,
and
of
their
Mongrel
Offspring
,
not
universal
It
may
be
urged
,
as
an
overwhelming
argument
,
that
there
must
be
some
essential
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
,
inasmuch
as
the
latter
,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
external
appearance
,
cross
with
perfect
facility
,
and
yield
perfectly
fertile
offspring
.
With
some
exceptions
,
presently
to
be
given
,
I
fully
admit
that
this
is
the
rule
.
But
the
subject
is
surrounded
by
difficulties
,
for
,
looking
to
varieties
produced
under
nature
,
if
two
forms
hitherto
reputed
to
be
varieties
be
found
in
any
degree
sterile
together
,
they
are
at
once
ranked
by
most
naturalists
as
species
.
For
instance
,
the
blue
and
red
pimpernel
,
which
are
considered
by
most
botanists
as
varieties
,
are
said
by
Gartner
to
be
quite
sterile
when
crossed
,
and
he
subsequently
ranks
them
as
undoubted
species
.
If
we
thus
argue
in
a
circle
,
the
fertility
of
all
varieties
produced
under
nature
will
assuredly
have
to
be
granted
.
If
we
turn
to
varieties
,
produced
,
or
supposed
to
have
been
produced
,
under
domestication
,
we
are
still
involved
in
some
doubt
.
For
when
it
is
stated
,
for
instance
,
that
certain
South
American
indigenous
domestic
dogs
do
not
readily
unite
with
European
dogs
,
the
explanation
which
will
occur
to
every
one
,
and
probably
the
true
one
,
is
that
they
are
descended
from
aboriginally
distinct
species
.
Nevertheless
the
perfect
fertility
of
so
many
domestic
races
,
differing
widely
from
each
other
in
appearance
,
for
instance
those
of
the
pigeon
,
or
of
the
cabbage
,
is
a
remarkable
fact
;
more
especially
when
we
reflect
how
many
species
there
are
,
which
,
though
resembling
each
other
most
closely
,
are
utterly
sterile
when
intercrossed
.
Several
considerations
however
,
render
the
fertility
of
domestic
varieties
less
remarkable
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
may
be
observed
that
the
amount
of
external
difference
between
two
species
is
no
sure
guide
to
their
degree
of
mutual
sterility
,
so
that
similar
differences
in
the
case
of
varieties
would
be
no
sure
guide
.
It
is
certain
that
with
species
the
cause
lies
exclusively
in
differences
in
their
sexual
constitution
.
Now
the
varying
conditions
to
which
domesticated
animals
and
cultivated
plants
have
been
subjected
,
have
had
so
little
tendency
towards
modifying
the
reproductive
system
in
a
manner
leading
to
mutual
sterility
,
that
we
have
good
grounds
for
admitting
the
directly
opposite
doctrine
of
Pallas
,
namely
,
that
such
conditions
generally
eliminate
this
tendency
;
so
that
the
domesticated
descendants
of
species
,
which
in
their
natural
state
probably
would
have
been
in
some
degree
sterile
when
crossed
,
become
perfectly
fertile
together
.
With
plants
,
so
far
is
cultivation
from
giving
a
tendency
towards
sterility
between
distinct
species
,
that
in
several
well
authenticated
cases
already
alluded
to
,
certain
plants
have
been
affected
in
an
opposite
manner
,
for
they
have
become
self
impotent
whilst
still
retaining
the
capacity
of
fertilising
,
and
being
fertilised
by
,
other
species
.
If
the
Pallasian
doctrine
of
the
elimination
of
sterility
through
long
continued
domestication
be
admitted
,
and
it
can
hardly
be
rejected
,
it
becomes
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
that
similar
conditions
long
continued
should
likewise
induce
this
tendency
;
though
in
certain
cases
,
with
species
having
a
peculiar
constitution
,
sterility
might
occasionally
be
thus
caused
.
Thus
,
as
I
believe
,
we
can
understand
why
with
domesticated
animals
varieties
have
not
been
produced
which
are
mutually
sterile
;
and
why
with
plants
only
a
few
such
cases
,
immediately
to
be
given
,
have
been
observed
.
The
real
difficulty
in
our
present
subject
is
not
,
as
it
appears
to
me
,
why
domestic
varieties
have
not
become
mutually
infertile
when
crossed
,
but
why
this
has
so
generally
occurred
with
natural
varieties
,
as
soon
as
they
have
been
permanently
modified
in
a
sufficient
degree
to
take
rank
as
species
.
We
are
far
from
precisely
knowing
the
cause
;
nor
is
this
surprising
,
seeing
how
profoundly
ignorant
we
are
in
regard
to
the
normal
and
abnormal
action
of
the
reproductive
system
.
But
we
can
see
that
species
,
owing
to
their
struggle
for
existence
with
numerous
competitors
,
will
have
been
exposed
during
long
periods
of
time
to
more
uniform
conditions
,
than
have
domestic
varieties
;
and
this
may
well
make
a
wide
difference
in
the
result
.
For
we
know
how
commonly
wild
animals
and
plants
,
when
taken
from
their
natural
conditions
and
subjected
to
captivity
,
are
rendered
sterile
;
and
the
reproductive
functions
of
organic
beings
which
have
always
lived
under
natural
conditions
would
probably
in
like
manner
be
eminently
sensitive
to
the
influence
of
an
unnatural
cross
.
Domesticated
productions
,
on
the
other
hand
,
which
,
as
shown
by
the
mere
fact
of
their
domestication
,
were
not
originally
highly
sensitive
to
changes
in
their
conditions
of
life
,
and
which
can
now
generally
resist
with
undiminished
fertility
repeated
changes
of
conditions
,
might
be
expected
to
produce
varieties
,
which
would
be
little
liable
to
have
their
reproductive
powers
injuriously
affected
by
the
act
of
crossing
with
other
varieties
which
had
originated
in
a
like
manner
.
I
have
not
as
yet
spoken
as
if
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
were
invariably
fertile
when
intercrossed
.
But
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
amount
of
sterility
in
the
few
following
cases
,
which
I
will
briefly
abstract
.
The
evidence
is
at
least
as
good
as
that
from
which
we
believe
in
the
sterility
of
a
multitude
of
species
.
The
evidence
is
,
also
,
derived
from
hostile
witnesses
,
who
in
all
other
cases
consider
fertility
and
sterility
as
safe
criterions
of
specific
distinction
.
Gartner
kept
during
several
years
a
dwarf
kind
of
maize
with
yellow
seeds
,
and
a
tall
variety
with
red
seeds
growing
near
each
other
in
his
garden
;
and
although
these
plants
have
separated
sexes
,
they
never
naturally
crossed
.
He
then
fertilised
thirteen
flowers
of
the
one
kind
with
pollen
of
the
other
;
but
only
a
single
head
produced
any
seed
,
and
this
one
head
produced
only
five
grains
.
Manipulation
in
this
case
could
not
have
been
injurious
,
as
the
plants
have
separated
sexes
.
No
one
,
I
believe
,
has
suspected
that
these
varieties
of
maize
are
distinct
species
;
and
it
is
important
to
notice
that
the
hybrid
plants
thus
raised
were
themselves
perfectly
fertile
;
so
that
even
Gartner
did
not
venture
to
consider
the
two
varieties
as
specifically
distinct
.
Girou
de
Buzareingues
crossed
three
varieties
of
gourd
,
which
like
the
maize
has
separated
sexes
,
and
he
asserts
that
their
mutual
fertilization
is
by
so
much
the
less
easy
as
their
differences
are
greater
.
How
far
these
experiments
may
be
trusted
,
I
know
not
;
but
the
forms
experimented
on
are
ranked
by
Sageret
,
who
mainly
founds
his
classification
by
the
test
of
infertility
,
as
varieties
,
and
Naudin
has
come
to
the
same
conclusion
.
The
following
case
is
far
more
remarkable
,
and
seems
at
first
incredible
;
but
it
is
the
result
of
an
astonishing
number
of
experiments
made
during
many
years
on
nine
species
of
Verbascum
,
by
so
good
an
observer
and
so
hostile
a
witness
as
Gartner
:
namely
,
that
the
yellow
and
white
varieties
when
crossed
produce
less
seed
than
the
similarly
coloured
varieties
of
the
same
species
.
Moreover
,
he
asserts
that
,
when
yellow
and
white
varieties
of
one
species
are
crossed
with
yellow
and
white
varieties
of
a
distinct
species
,
more
seed
is
produced
by
the
crosses
between
the
similarly
coloured
flowers
,
than
between
those
which
are
differently
coloured
.
Mr
.
Scott
also
has
experimented
on
the
species
and
varieties
of
Verbascum
;
and
although
unable
to
confirm
Gartner's
results
on
the
crossing
of
the
distinct
species
,
he
finds
that
the
dissimilarly
coloured
varieties
of
the
same
species
yield
fewer
seeds
in
the
proportion
of
86
to
100
,
than
the
similarly
coloured
varieties
.
Yet
these
varieties
differ
in
no
respect
except
in
the
colour
of
their
flowers
;
and
one
variety
can
sometimes
be
raised
from
the
seed
of
another
.
Kolreuter
,
whose
accuracy
has
been
confirmed
by
every
subsequent
observer
,
has
proved
the
remarkable
fact
,
that
one
particular
variety
of
the
common
tobacco
was
more
fertile
than
the
other
varieties
,
when
crossed
with
a
widely
distinct
species
.
He
experimented
on
five
forms
which
are
commonly
reputed
to
be
varieties
,
and
which
he
tested
by
the
severest
trial
,
namely
,
by
reciprocal
crosses
,
and
he
found
their
mongrel
offspring
perfectly
fertile
.
But
one
of
these
five
varieties
,
when
used
either
as
the
father
or
mother
,
and
crossed
with
the
Nicotiana
glutinosa
,
always
yielded
hybrids
not
so
sterile
as
those
which
were
produced
from
the
four
other
varieties
when
crossed
with
N
.
glutinosa
.
Hence
the
reproductive
system
of
this
one
variety
must
have
been
in
some
manner
and
in
some
degree
modified
.
From
these
facts
it
can
no
longer
be
maintained
that
varieties
when
crossed
are
invariably
quite
fertile
.
From
the
great
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
infertility
of
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
,
for
a
supposed
variety
,
if
proved
to
be
infertile
in
any
degree
,
would
almost
universally
be
ranked
as
a
species
;
from
man
attending
only
to
external
characters
in
his
domestic
varieties
,
and
from
such
varieties
not
having
been
exposed
for
very
long
periods
to
uniform
conditions
of
life
;
from
these
several
considerations
we
may
conclude
that
fertility
does
not
constitute
a
fundamental
distinction
between
varieties
and
species
when
crossed
.
The
general
sterility
of
crossed
species
may
safely
be
looked
at
,
not
as
a
special
acquirement
or
endowment
,
but
as
incidental
on
changes
of
an
unknown
nature
in
their
sexual
elements
.
Hybrids
and
Mongrels
compared
,
independently
of
their
fertility
Independently
of
the
question
of
fertility
,
the
offspring
of
species
and
of
varieties
when
crossed
may
be
compared
in
several
other
respects
.
Gartner
,
whose
strong
wish
it
was
to
draw
a
distinct
line
between
species
and
varieties
,
could
find
very
few
,
and
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
quite
unimportant
differences
between
the
so
called
hybrid
offspring
of
species
,
and
the
so
called
mongrel
offspring
of
varieties
.
And
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
agree
most
closely
in
many
important
respects
.
I
shall
here
discuss
this
subject
with
extreme
brevity
.
The
most
important
distinction
is
,
that
in
the
first
generation
mongrels
are
more
variable
than
hybrids
;
but
Gartner
admits
that
hybrids
from
species
which
have
long
been
cultivated
are
often
variable
in
the
first
generation
;
and
I
have
myself
seen
striking
instances
of
this
fact
.
Gartner
further
admits
that
hybrids
between
very
closely
allied
species
are
more
variable
than
those
from
very
distinct
species
;
and
this
shows
that
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
variability
graduates
away
.
When
mongrels
and
the
more
fertile
hybrids
are
propagated
for
several
generations
,
an
extreme
amount
of
variability
in
the
offspring
in
both
cases
is
notorious
;
but
some
few
instances
of
both
hybrids
and
mongrels
long
retaining
a
uniform
character
could
be
given
.
The
variability
,
however
,
in
the
successive
generations
of
mongrels
is
,
perhaps
,
greater
than
in
hybrids
.
This
greater
variability
in
mongrels
than
in
hybrids
does
not
seem
at
all
surprising
.
For
the
parents
of
mongrels
are
varieties
,
and
mostly
domestic
varieties
(
very
few
experiments
having
been
tried
on
natural
varieties
)
,
and
this
implies
that
there
has
been
recent
variability
,
which
would
often
continue
and
would
augment
that
arising
from
the
act
of
crossing
.
The
slight
variability
of
hybrids
in
the
first
generation
,
in
contrast
with
that
in
the
succeeding
generations
,
is
a
curious
fact
and
deserves
attention
.
For
it
bears
on
the
view
which
I
have
taken
of
one
of
the
causes
of
ordinary
variability
;
namely
,
that
the
reproductive
system
from
being
eminently
sensitive
to
changed
conditions
of
life
,
fails
under
these
circumstances
to
perform
its
proper
function
of
producing
offspring
closely
similar
in
all
respects
to
the
parent
form
.
Now
hybrids
in
the
first
generation
are
descended
from
species
(
excluding
those
long
cultivated
)
which
have
not
had
their
reproductive
systems
in
any
way
affected
,
and
they
are
not
variable
;
but
hybrids
themselves
have
their
reproductive
systems
seriously
affected
,
and
their
descendants
are
highly
variable
.
But
to
return
to
our
comparison
of
mongrels
and
hybrids
:
Gartner
states
that
mongrels
are
more
liable
than
hybrids
to
revert
to
either
parent
form
;
but
this
,
if
it
be
true
,
is
certainly
only
a
difference
in
degree
.
Moreover
,
Gartner
expressly
states
that
hybrids
from
long
cultivated
plants
are
more
subject
to
reversion
than
hybrids
from
species
in
their
natural
state
;
and
this
probably
explains
the
singular
difference
in
the
results
arrived
at
by
different
observers
:
thus
Max
Wichura
doubts
whether
hybrids
ever
revert
to
their
parent
forms
,
and
he
experimented
on
uncultivated
species
of
willows
;
whilst
Naudin
,
on
the
other
hand
,
insists
in
the
strongest
terms
on
the
almost
universal
tendency
to
reversion
in
hybrids
,
and
he
experimented
chiefly
on
cultivated
plants
.
Gartner
further
states
that
when
any
two
species
,
although
most
closely
allied
to
each
other
,
are
crossed
with
a
third
species
,
the
hybrids
are
widely
different
from
each
other
;
whereas
if
two
very
distinct
varieties
of
one
species
are
crossed
with
another
species
,
the
hybrids
do
not
differ
much
.
But
this
conclusion
,
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
is
founded
on
a
single
experiment
;
and
seems
directly
opposed
to
the
results
of
several
experiments
made
by
Kolreuter
.
Such
alone
are
the
unimportant
differences
which
Gartner
is
able
to
point
out
between
hybrid
and
mongrel
plants
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
degrees
and
kinds
of
resemblance
in
mongrels
and
in
hybrids
to
their
respective
parents
,
more
especially
in
hybrids
produced
from
nearly
related
species
,
follow
according
to
Gartner
the
same
laws
.
When
two
species
are
crossed
,
one
has
sometimes
a
prepotent
power
of
impressing
its
likeness
on
the
hybrid
.
So
I
believe
it
to
be
with
varieties
of
plants
;
and
with
animals
one
variety
certainly
often
has
this
prepotent
power
over
another
variety
.
Hybrid
plants
produced
from
a
reciprocal
cross
,
generally
resemble
each
other
closely
;
and
so
it
is
with
mongrel
plants
from
a
reciprocal
cross
.
Both
hybrids
and
mongrels
can
be
reduced
to
either
pure
parent
form
,
by
repeated
crosses
in
successive
generations
with
either
parent
.
These
several
remarks
are
apparently
applicable
to
animals
;
but
the
subject
is
here
much
complicated
,
partly
owing
to
the
existence
of
secondary
sexual
characters
;
but
more
especially
owing
to
prepotency
in
transmitting
likeness
running
more
strongly
in
one
sex
than
in
the
other
,
both
when
one
species
is
crossed
with
another
,
and
when
one
variety
is
crossed
with
another
variety
.
For
instance
,
I
think
those
authors
are
right
who
maintain
that
the
ass
has
a
prepotent
power
over
the
horse
,
so
that
both
the
mule
and
the
hinny
resemble
more
closely
the
ass
than
the
horse
;
but
that
the
prepotency
runs
more
strongly
in
the
male
than
in
the
female
ass
,
so
that
the
mule
,
which
is
the
offspring
of
the
male
ass
and
mare
,
is
more
like
an
ass
,
than
is
the
hinny
,
which
is
the
offspring
of
the
female
ass
and
stallion
.
Much
stress
has
been
laid
by
some
authors
on
the
supposed
fact
,
that
it
is
only
with
mongrels
that
the
offspring
are
not
intermediate
in
character
,
but
closely
resemble
one
of
their
parents
;
but
this
does
sometimes
occur
with
hybrids
,
yet
I
grant
much
less
frequently
than
with
mongrels
.
Looking
to
the
cases
which
I
have
collected
of
cross
bred
animals
closely
resembling
one
parent
,
the
resemblances
seem
chiefly
confined
to
characters
almost
monstrous
in
their
nature
,
and
which
have
suddenly
appeared
such
as
albinism
,
melanism
,
deficiency
of
tail
or
horns
,
or
additional
fingers
and
toes
;
and
do
not
relate
to
characters
which
have
been
slowly
acquired
through
selection
.
A
tendency
to
sudden
reversions
to
the
perfect
character
of
either
parent
would
,
also
,
be
much
more
likely
to
occur
with
mongrels
,
which
are
descended
from
varieties
often
suddenly
produced
and
semi
monstrous
in
character
,
than
with
hybrids
,
which
are
descended
from
species
slowly
and
naturally
produced
On
the
whole
,
I
entirely
agree
with
Dr
.
Prosper
Lucas
,
who
,
after
arranging
an
enormous
body
of
facts
with
respect
to
animals
,
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
laws
of
resemblance
of
the
child
to
its
parents
are
the
same
,
whether
the
two
parents
differ
little
or
much
from
each
other
,
namely
,
in
the
union
of
individuals
of
the
same
variety
,
or
of
different
varieties
,
or
of
distinct
species
.
Independently
of
the
question
of
fertility
and
sterility
,
in
all
other
respects
there
seems
to
be
a
general
and
close
similarity
in
the
offspring
of
crossed
species
,
and
of
crossed
varieties
.
If
we
look
at
species
as
having
been
specially
created
,
and
at
varieties
as
having
been
produced
by
secondary
laws
,
this
similarity
would
be
an
astonishing
fact
.
But
it
harmonises
perfectly
with
the
view
that
there
is
no
essential
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
.
Summary
of
Chapter
First
crosses
between
forms
,
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
ranked
as
species
,
and
their
hybrids
,
are
very
generally
,
but
not
universally
,
sterile
.
The
sterility
is
of
all
degrees
,
and
is
often
so
slight
that
the
most
careful
experimentalists
have
arrived
at
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
ranking
forms
by
this
test
.
The
sterility
is
innately
variable
in
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
is
eminently
susceptible
to
the
action
of
favourable
and
unfavourable
conditions
.
The
degree
of
sterility
does
not
strictly
follow
systematic
affinity
,
but
is
governed
by
several
curious
and
complex
laws
.
It
is
generally
different
,
and
sometimes
widely
different
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
.
It
is
not
always
equal
in
degree
in
a
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrids
produced
from
this
cross
.
In
the
same
manner
as
in
grafting
trees
,
the
capacity
in
one
species
or
variety
to
take
on
another
,
is
incidental
on
differences
,
generally
of
an
unknown
nature
,
in
their
vegetative
systems
,
so
in
crossing
,
the
greater
or
less
facility
of
one
species
to
unite
with
another
is
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
reproductive
systems
.
There
is
no
more
reason
to
think
that
species
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
degrees
of
sterility
to
prevent
their
crossing
and
blending
in
nature
,
than
to
think
that
trees
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
and
somewhat
analogous
degrees
of
difficulty
in
being
grafted
together
in
order
to
prevent
their
inarching
in
our
forests
.
The
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
their
hybrid
progeny
has
not
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
.
In
the
case
of
first
crosses
it
seems
to
depend
on
several
circumstances
;
in
some
instances
in
chief
part
on
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
.
In
the
case
of
hybrids
,
it
apparently
depends
on
their
whole
organisation
having
been
disturbed
by
being
compounded
from
two
distinct
forms
;
the
sterility
being
closely
allied
to
that
which
so
frequently
affects
pure
species
,
when
exposed
to
new
and
unnatural
conditions
of
life
.
He
who
will
explain
these
latter
cases
will
be
able
to
explain
the
sterility
of
hybrids
.
This
view
is
strongly
supported
by
a
parallelism
of
another
kind
:
namely
,
that
,
firstly
,
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
add
to
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
all
organic
beings
;
and
secondly
,
that
the
crossing
of
forms
,
which
have
been
exposed
to
slightly
different
conditions
of
life
or
which
have
varied
,
favours
the
size
,
vigour
,
and
fertility
of
their
offspring
.
The
facts
given
on
the
sterility
of
the
illegitimate
unions
of
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
and
of
their
illegitimate
progeny
,
perhaps
render
it
probable
that
some
unknown
bond
in
all
cases
connects
the
degree
of
fertility
of
first
unions
with
that
of
their
offspring
.
The
consideration
of
these
facts
on
dimorphism
,
as
well
as
of
the
results
of
reciprocal
crosses
,
clearly
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
primary
cause
of
the
sterility
of
crossed
species
is
confined
to
differences
in
their
sexual
elements
.
But
why
,
in
the
case
of
distinct
species
,
the
sexual
elements
should
so
generally
have
become
more
or
less
modified
,
leading
to
their
mutual
infertility
,
we
do
not
know
;
but
it
seems
to
stand
in
some
close
relation
to
species
having
been
exposed
for
long
periods
of
time
to
nearly
uniform
conditions
of
life
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
the
difficulty
in
crossing
any
two
species
,
and
the
sterility
of
their
hybrid
offspring
,
should
in
most
cases
correspond
,
even
if
due
to
distinct
causes
:
for
both
depend
on
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
species
which
are
crossed
.
Nor
is
it
surprising
that
the
facility
of
effecting
a
first
cross
,
and
the
fertility
of
the
hybrids
thus
produced
,
and
the
capacity
of
being
grafted
together
though
this
latter
capacity
evidently
depends
on
widely
different
circumstances
should
all
run
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
parallel
with
the
systematic
affinity
of
the
forms
subjected
to
experiment
;
for
systematic
affinity
includes
resemblances
of
all
kinds
.

,
or
sufficiently
alike
to
be
considered
as
varieties
,
and
their
mongrel
offspring
,
are
very
generally
,
but
not
,
as
is
so
often
stated
,
invariably
fertile
.
Nor
is
this
almost
universal
and
perfect
fertility
surprising
,
when
it
is
remembered
how
liable
we
are
to
argue
in
a
circle
with
respect
to
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
;
and
when
we
remember
that
the
greater
number
of
varieties
have
been
produced
under
domestication
by
the
selection
of
mere
external
differences
,
and
that
they
have
not
been
long
exposed
to
uniform
conditions
of
life
.
It
should
also
be
especially
kept
in
mind
,
that
long
continued
domestication
tends
to
eliminate
sterility
,
and
is
therefore
little
likely
to
induce
this
same
quality
.
Independently
of
the
question
of
fertility
,
in
all
other
respects
there
is
the
closest
general
resemblance
between
hybrids
and
mongrels
,
in
their
variability
,
in
their
power
of
absorbing
each
other
by
repeated
crosses
,
and
in
their
inheritance
of
characters
from
both
parent
forms
.
Finally
,
then
,
although
we
are
as
ignorant
of
the
precise
cause
of
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
as
we
are
why
animals
and
plants
removed
from
their
natural
conditions
become
sterile
,
yet
the
facts
given
in
this
chapter
do
not
seem
to
me
opposed
to
the
belief
that
species
aboriginally
existed
as
varieties
.
CHAPTER
X
ON
THE
IMPERFECTION
OF
THE
GEOLOGICAL
RECORD
IN
THE
sixth
chapter
I
enumerated
the
chief
objections
which
might
be
justly
urged
against
the
views
maintained
in
this
volume
.
Most
of
them
have
now
been
discussed
.
One
,
namely
the
distinctness
of
specific
forms
,
and
their
not
being
blended
together
by
innumerable
transitional
links
,
is
a
very
obvious
difficulty
.
I
assigned
reasons
why
such
links
do
not
commonly
occur
at
the
present
day
under
the
circumstances
apparently
most
favourable
for
their
presence
,
namely
,
on
an
extensive
and
continuous
area
with
graduated
physical
conditions
.
I
endeavoured
to
show
,
that
the
life
of
each
species
depends
in
a
more
important
manner
on
the
presence
of
other
already
defined
organic
forms
,
than
on
climate
,
and
,
therefore
,
that
the
really
governing
conditions
of
life
do
not
graduate
away
quite
insensibly
like
heat
or
moisture
.
I
endeavoured
,
also
,
to
show
that
intermediate
varieties
,
from
existing
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
,
will
generally
be
beaten
out
and
exterminated
during
the
course
of
further
modification
and
improvement
.
The
main
cause
,
however
,
of
innumerable
intermediate
links
not
now
occurring
everywhere
throughout
nature
,
depends
on
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
,
through
which
new
varieties
continually
take
the
places
of
and
supplant
their
parent
forms
.
But
just
in
proportion
as
this
process
of
extermination
has
acted
on
an
enormous
scale
,
so
must
the
number
of
intermediate
varieties
,
which
have
formerly
existed
,
be
truly
enormous
.
Why
then
is
not
every
geological
formation
and
every
stratum
full
of
such
intermediate
links
?
Geology
assuredly
does
not
reveal
any
such
finely
graduated
organic
chain
;
and
this
,
perhaps
,
is
the
most
obvious
and
serious
objection
which
can
be
urged
against
the
theory
.
The
explanation
lies
,
as
I
believe
,
in
the
extreme
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
what
sort
of
intermediate
forms
must
,
on
the
theory
,
have
formerly
existed
.
I
have
found
it
difficult
,
when
looking
at
any
two
species
,
to
avoid
picturing
to
myself
forms
directly
intermediate
between
them
.
But
this
is
a
wholly
false
view
;
we
should
always
look
for
forms
intermediate
between
each
species
and
a
common
but
unknown
progenitor
;
and
the
progenitor
will
generally
have
differed
in
some
respects
from
all
its
modified
descendants
.
To
give
a
simple
illustration
:
the
fantail
and
pouter
pigeons
are
both
descended
from
the
rock
pigeon
;
if
we
possessed
all
the
intermediate
varieties
which
have
ever
existed
,
we
should
have
an
extremely
close
series
between
both
and
the
rock
pigeon
;
but
we
should
have
no
varieties
directly
intermediate
between
the
fantail
and
pouter
;
none
,
for
instance
,
combining
a
tail
somewhat
expanded
with
a
crop
somewhat
enlarged
,
the
characteristic
features
of
these
two
breeds
.
These
two
breeds
,
moreover
,
have
become
so
much
modified
,
that
,
if
we
had
no
historical
or
indirect
evidence
regarding
their
origin
,
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
determined
,
from
a
mere
comparison
of
their
structure
with
that
of
the
rock
pigeon
,
C
.
livia
,
whether
they
had
descended
from
this
species
or
from
some
allied
form
,
such
as
C
.
aenas
.
So
,
with
natural
species
,
if
we
look
to
forms
very
distinct
,
for
instance
to
the
horse
and
tapir
,
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
links
directly
intermediate
between
them
ever
existed
,
but
between
each
and
an
unknown
common
parent
.
The
common
parent
will
have
had
in
its
whole
organisation
much
general
resemblance
to
the
tapir
and
to
the
horse
;
but
in
some
points
of
structure
may
have
differed
considerably
from
both
,
even
perhaps
more
than
they
differ
from
each
other
.
Hence
,
in
all
such
cases
,
we
should
be
unable
to
recognise
the
parent
form
of
any
two
or
more
species
,
even
if
we
closely
compared
the
structure
of
the
parent
with
that
of
its
modified
descendants
,
unless
at
the
same
time
we
had
a
nearly
perfect
chain
of
the
intermediate
links
.
It
is
just
possible
by
theory
,
that
one
of
two
living
forms
might
have
descended
from
the
other
;
for
instance
,
a
horse
from
a
tapir
;
and
in
this
case
direct
intermediate
links
will
have
existed
between
them
.
But
such
a
case
would
imply
that
one
form
had
remained
for
a
very
long
period
unaltered
,
whilst
its
descendants
had
undergone
a
vast
amount
of
change
;
and
the
principle
of
competition
between
organism
and
organism
,
between
child
and
parent
,
will
render
this
a
very
rare
event
;
for
in
all
cases
the
new
and
improved
forms
of
life
tend
to
supplant
the
old
and
unimproved
forms
.
By
the
theory
of
natural
selection
all
living
species
have
been
connected
with
the
parent
species
of
each
genus
,
by
differences
not
greater
than
we
see
between
the
natural
and
domestic
varieties
of
the
same
species
at
the
present
day
;
and
these
parent
species
,
now
generally
extinct
,
have
in
their
turn
been
similarly
connected
with
more
ancient
forms
;
and
so
on
backwards
,
always
converging
to
the
common
ancestor
of
each
great
class
.
So
that
the
number
of
intermediate
and
transitional
links
,
between
all
living
and
extinct
species
,
must
have
been
inconceivably
great
.
But
assuredly
,
if
this
theory
be
true
,
such
have
lived
upon
the
earth
.
On
the
Lapse
of
Time
,
as
inferred
from
the
rate
of
Deposition
and
extent
of
Denudation
Independently
of
our
not
finding
fossil
remains
of
such
infinitely
numerous
connecting
links
,
it
may
be
objected
that
time
cannot
have
sufficed
for
so
great
an
amount
of
organic
change
,
all
changes
having
been
effected
slowly
.
It
is
hardly
possible
for
me
to
recall
to
the
reader
who
is
not
a
practical
geologist
,
the
facts
leading
the
mind
feebly
to
comprehend
the
lapse
of
time
.
He
who
can
read
Sir
Charles
Lyell's
grand
work
on
the
Principles
of
Geology
,
which
the
future
historian
will
recognise
as
having
produced
a
revolution
in
natural
science
,
and
yet
does
not
admit
how
vast
have
been
the
past
periods
of
time
,
may
at
once
close
this
volume
.
Not
that
it
suffices
to
study
the
Principles
of
Geology
,
or
to
read
special
treatises
by
different
observers
on
separate
formations
,
and
to
mark
how
each
author
attempts
,
to
give
an
inadequate
idea
of
the
duration
of
each
formation
,
or
even
of
each
stratum
.
We
can
best
gain
some
idea
of
past
time
by
knowing
the
agencies
at
work
,
and
learning
how
deeply
the
surface
of
the
land
has
been
denuded
,
and
how
much
sediment
has
been
deposited
.
As
Lyell
has
well
remarked
,
the
extent
and
thickness
of
our
sedimentary
formations
are
the
result
and
the
measure
of
the
denudation
which
the
earth's
crust
has
elsewhere
undergone
.
Therefore
a
man
should
examine
for
himself
the
great
piles
of
superimposed
strata
,
and
watch
the
rivulets
bringing
down
mud
,
and
the
waves
wearing
away
the
sea
cliffs
,
in
order
to
comprehend
something
about
the
duration
of
past
time
,
the
monuments
of
which
we
see
all
around
us
.
It
is
good
to
wander
along
the
coast
,
when
formed
of
moderately
hard
rocks
,
and
mark
the
process
of
degradation
.
The
tides
in
most
cases
reach
the
cliffs
only
for
a
short
time
twice
a
day
,
and
the
waves
eat
into
them
only
when
they
are
charged
with
sand
or
pebbles
;
for
there
is
good
evidence
that
pure
water
effects
nothing
in
wearing
away
rock
.
At
last
the
base
of
the
cliff
is
undermined
,
huge
fragments
fall
down
,
and
these
,
remaining
fixed
,
have
to
be
worn
away
atom
by
atom
,
until
after
being
reduced
in
size
they
can
be
rolled
about
by
the
waves
,
and
then
they
are
more
quickly
ground
into
pebbles
,
sand
,
or
mud
.
But
how
often
do
we
see
along
the
bases
of
retreating
cliffs
rounded
boulders
,
all
thickly
clothed
by
marine
productions
,
showing
how
little
they
are
abraded
and
how
seldom
they
are
rolled
about!
Moreover
,
if
we
follow
for
a
few
miles
any
line
of
rocky
cliff
,
which
is
undergoing
degradation
,
we
find
that
it
is
only
here
and
there
,
along
a
short
length
or
round
a
promontory
,
that
the
cliffs
are
at
the
present
time
suffering
.
The
appearance
of
the
surface
and
the
vegetation
show
that
elsewhere
years
have
elapsed
since
the
waters
washed
their
base
.
We
have
,
however
,
recently
learnt
from
the
observations
of
Ramsay
,
in
the
van
of
many
excellent
observers
of
Jukes
,
Geikie
,
Croll
,
and
others
,
that
subaerial
degradation
is
a
much
more
important
agency
than
coast
action
,
or
the
power
of
the
waves
.
The
whole
surface
of
the
land
is
exposed
to
the
chemical
action
of
the
air
and
of
the
rain
water
with
its
dissolved
carbolic
acid
,
and
in
colder
countries
to
frost
;
the
disintegrated
matter
is
carried
down
even
gentle
slopes
during
heavy
rain
,
and
to
a
greater
extent
than
might
be
supposed
,
especially
in
arid
districts
,
by
the
wind
;
it
is
then
transported
by
the
streams
and
rivers
,
which
when
rapid
deepen
their
channels
,
and
triturate
the
fragments
.
On
a
rainy
day
,
even
in
a
gently
undulating
country
,
we
see
the
effects
of
subaerial
degradation
in
the
muddy
rills
which
flow
down
every
slope
.
Messrs
.
Ramsay
and
Whitaker
have
shown
,
and
the
observation
is
a
most
striking
one
,
that
the
great
lines
of
escarpment
in
the
Wealden
district
and
those
ranging
across
England
,
which
formerly
were
looked
at
as
ancient
sea
coasts
,
cannot
have
been
thus
formed
,
for
each
line
is
composed
of
one
and
the
same
formation
,
whilst
our
sea
cliffs
are
everywhere
formed
by
the
intersection
of
various
formations
.
This
being
the
case
,
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
the
escarpments
owe
their
origin
in
chief
part
to
the
rocks
of
which
they
are
composed
having
resisted
subaerial
denudation
better
than
the
surrounding
surface
;
this
surface
consequently
has
been
gradually
lowered
,
with
the
lines
of
harder
rock
left
projecting
.
Nothing
impresses
the
mind
with
the
vast
duration
of
time
,
according
to
our
ideas
of
time
,
more
forcibly
than
the
conviction
thus
gained
that
subaerial
agencies
which
apparently
have
so
little
power
,
and
which
seem
to
work
so
slowly
,
have
produced
great
results
.
When
thus
impressed
with
the
slow
rate
at
which
the
land
is
worn
away
through
subaerial
and
littoral
action
,
it
is
good
,
in
order
to
appreciate
the
past
duration
of
time
,
to
consider
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
masses
of
rock
which
have
been
removed
over
many
extensive
areas
,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
thickness
of
our
sedimentary
formations
.
I
remember
having
been
much
struck
when
viewing
volcanic
islands
,
which
have
been
worn
by
the
waves
and
pared
all
round
into
perpendicular
cliffs
of
one
or
two
thousand
feet
in
height
;
for
the
gentle
slope
of
the
lava
streams
,
due
to
their
formerly
liquid
state
,
showed
at
a
glance
how
far
the
hard
,
rocky
beds
had
once
extended
into
the
open
ocean
.
The
same
story
is
told
still
more
plainly
by
faults
,
those
great
cracks
along
which
the
strata
have
been
upheaved
on
one
side
,
or
thrown
down
on
the
other
,
to
the
height
or
depth
of
thousands
of
feet
;
for
since
the
crust
cracked
,
and
it
makes
no
great
difference
whether
the
upheaval
was
sudden
,
or
,
as
most
geologists
now
believe
,
was
slow
and
effected
by
many
starts
,
the
surface
of
the
land
has
been
so
completely
planed
down
that
no
trace
of
these
vast
dislocations
is
externally
visible
.
The
Craven
fault
,
for
instance
,
extends
for
upwards
of
30
miles
,
and
along
this
line
the
vertical
displacement
of
the
strata
varies
from
600
to
3000
feet
.
Professor
Ramsay
has
published
an
account
of
a
downthrow
in
Anglesea
of
2300
feet
;
and
he
informs
me
that
he
fully
believes
that
there
is
one
in
Merionethshire
of
12
,
000
feet
;
yet
in
these
cases
there
is
nothing
on
the
surface
of
the
land
to
show
such
prodigious
movements
;
the
pile
of
rocks
on
either
side
of
the
crack
having
been
smoothly
swept
away
.
On
the
other
hand
,
in
all
parts
of
the
world
the
piles
of
sedimentary
strata
are
of
wonderful
thickness
.
In
the
Cordillera
I
estimated
one
mass
of
conglomerate
at
ten
thousand
feet
;
and
although
conglomerates
have
probably
been
accumulated
at
a
quicker
rate
than
finer
sediments
,
yet
from
being
formed
of
worn
and
rounded
pebbles
,
each
of
which
bears
the
stamp
of
time
,
they
are
good
to
show
how
slowly
the
mass
must
have
been
heaped
together
.
Professor
Ramsay
has
given
me
the
maximum
thickness
,
from
actual
measurement
in
most
cases
,
of
the
successive
formations
in
different
parts
of
Great
Britain
;
and
this
is
the
result
:
Palaeozoic
strata
(
not
including
igneous
beds
)
57
,
154
feet
Secondary
strata
13
,
190
feet
Tertiary
strata
2
,
249
feet
making
altogether
72
,
584
feet
;
that
is
,
very
nearly
thirteen
and
three
quarters
British
miles
.
Some
of
the
formations
,
which
are
represented
in
England
by
thin
beds
,
are
thousands
of
feet
in
thickness
on
the
Continent
.
Moreover
,
between
each
successive
formation
,
we
have
,
in
the
opinion
of
most
geologists
,
blank
periods
of
enormous
length
.
So
that
the
lofty
pile
of
sedimentary
rocks
in
Britain
gives
but
an
inadequate
idea
of
the
time
which
has
elapsed
during
their
accumulation
.
The
consideration
of
these
various
facts
impresses
the
mind
almost
in
the
same
manner
as
does
the
vain
endeavour
to
grapple
with
the
idea
of
eternity
.
Nevertheless
this
impression
is
partly
false
.
Mr
.
Croll
,
in
an
interesting
paper
,
remarks
that
we
do
not
err
"
in
forming
too
great
a
conception
of
the
length
of
geological
periods
,
"
but
in
estimating
them
by
years
.
When
geologists
look
at
large
and
complicated
phenomena
,
and
then
at
the
figures
representing
several
million
years
,
the
two
produce
a
totally
different
effect
on
the
mind
,
and
the
figures
are
at
once
pronounced
too
small
.
In
regard
to
subaerial
denudation
,
Mr
.
Croll
shows
,
by
calculating
the
known
amount
of
sediment
annually
brought
down
by
certain
rivers
,
relatively
to
their
areas
of
drainage
,
that
1000
feet
of
solid
rock
,
as
it
became
gradually
disintegrated
,
would
thus
be
removed
from
the
mean
level
of
the
whole
area
in
the
course
of
six
million
years
.
This
seems
an
astonishing
result
,
and
some
considerations
lead
to
the
suspicion
that
it
may
be
too
large
,
but
even
if
halved
or
quartered
it
is
still
very
surprising
.
Few
of
us
,
however
,
know
what
a
million
really
means
:
Mr
.
Croll
gives
the
following
illustration
:
take
a
narrow
strip
of
paper
,
83
feet
4
inches
in
length
,
and
stretch
it
along
the
wall
of
a
large
hall
;
then
mark
off
at
one
end
the
tenth
of
an
inch
.
This
tenth
of
an
inch
will
represent
one
hundred
years
,
and
the
entire
strip
a
million
years
.
But
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
,
in
relation
to
the
subject
of
this
work
,
what
a
hundred
years
implies
,
represented
as
it
is
by
a
measure
utterly
insignificant
in
a
hall
of
the
above
dimensions
.
Several
eminent
breeders
,
during
a
single
lifetime
,
have
so
largely
modified
some
of
the
higher
animals
which
propagate
their
kind
much
more
slowly
than
most
of
the
lower
animals
,
that
they
have
formed
what
well
deserves
to
be
called
a
new
sub
breed
.
Few
men
have
attended
with
due
care
to
any
one
strain
for
more
than
half
a
century
,
so
that
a
hundred
years
represents
the
work
of
two
breeders
in
succession
.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
species
in
a
state
of
nature
ever
change
so
quickly
as
domestic
animals
under
the
guidance
of
methodical
selection
.
The
comparison
would
be
in
every
way
fairer
with
the
effects
which
follow
from
unconscious
selection
,
that
is
the
preservation
of
the
most
useful
or
beautiful
animals
,
with
no
intention
of
modifying
the
breed
;
but
by
this
process
of
unconscious
selection
,
various
breeds
have
been
sensibly
changed
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
centuries
.
Species
,
however
,
probably
change
much
more
slowly
,
and
within
the
same
country
only
a
few
change
at
the
same
time
.
This
slowness
follows
from
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
country
being
already
so
well
adapted
to
each
other
,
that
new
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
do
not
occur
until
after
long
intervals
,
due
to
the
occurrence
of
physical
changes
of
some
kind
,
or
through
the
immigration
of
new
forms
.
Moreover
variations
or
individual
differences
of
the
right
nature
,
by
which
some
of
the
inhabitants
might
be
better
fitted
to
their
new
places
under
the
altered
circumstances
,
would
not
always
occur
at
once
.
Unfortunately
we
have
no
means
of
determining
,
according
to
the
standards
of
years
,
how
long
a
period
it
takes
to
modify
a
species
;
but
to
the
subject
of
time
we
must
return
.
On
the
Poorness
of
Palaeontological
Collections
Now
let
us
turn
to
our
richest
geological
museums
,
and
what
a
paltry
display
we
behold!
That
our
collections
are
imperfect
is
admitted
by
every
one
.
The
remark
of
that
admirable
palaeontologist
,
Edward
Forbes
,
should
never
be
forgotten
,
namely
,
that
very
many
fossil
species
are
known
and
named
from
single
and
often
broken
specimens
,
or
from
a
few
specimens
collected
on
some
one
spot
.
Only
a
small
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
has
been
geologically
explored
,
and
no
part
with
sufficient
care
,
as
the
important
discoveries
made
every
year
in
Europe
prove
.
No
organism
wholly
soft
can
be
preserved
.
Shells
and
bones
decay
and
disappear
when
left
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
where
sediment
is
not
accumulating
.
We
probably
take
a
quite
erroneous
view
,
when
we
assume
that
sediment
is
being
deposited
over
nearly
the
whole
bed
of
the
sea
,
at
a
rate
sufficiently
quick
to
embed
and
preserve
fossil
remains
.
Throughout
an
enormously
large
proportion
of
the
ocean
,
the
bright
blue
tint
of
the
water
bespeaks
its
purity
.
The
many
cases
on
record
of
a
formation
conformably
covered
,
after
an
immense
interval
of
time
,
by
another
and
later
formation
,
without
the
underlying
bed
having
suffered
in
the
interval
any
wear
and
tear
,
seem
explicable
only
on
the
view
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
not
rarely
lying
for
ages
in
an
unaltered
condition
.
The
remains
which
do
become
embedded
,
if
in
sand
or
gravel
,
will
,
when
the
beds
are
upraised
,
generally
be
dissolved
by
the
percolation
of
rain
water
charged
with
carbolic
acid
.
Some
of
the
many
kinds
of
animals
which
live
on
the
beach
between
high
and
low
water
mark
seem
to
be
rarely
preserved
.
For
instance
,
the
several
species
of
the
Chthamalinae
(
a
sub
family
of
sessile
cirripedes
)
coat
the
rocks
all
over
the
world
in
infinite
numbers
:
they
are
all
strictly
littoral
,
with
the
exception
of
a
single
Mediterranean
species
,
which
inhabits
deep
water
,
and
this
has
been
found
fossil
in
Sicily
,
whereas
not
one
other
species
has
hitherto
been
found
in
any
tertiary
formation
:
yet
it
is
known
that
the
genus
Chthamalus
existed
during
the
Chalk
period
.
Lastly
,
many
great
deposits
requiring
a
vast
length
of
time
for
their
accumulation
,
are
entirely
destitute
of
organic
remains
,
without
our
being
able
to
assign
any
reason
:
one
of
the
most
striking
instances
is
that
of
the
Flysch
formation
,
which
consists
of
shale
and
sandstone
,
several
thousand
,
occasionally
even
six
thousand
feet
in
thickness
,
and
extending
for
at
least
300
miles
from
Vienna
to
Switzerland
;
and
although
this
great
mass
has
been
most
carefully
searched
,
no
fossils
,
except
a
few
vegetable
remains
,
have
been
found
.
With
respect
to
the
terrestrial
productions
which
lived
during
the
Secondary
and
Palaeozoic
periods
,
it
is
superfluous
to
state
that
our
evidence
is
fragmentary
in
an
extreme
degree
.
For
instance
,
until
recently
not
a
land
shell
was
known
belonging
to
either
of
these
vast
periods
,
with
the
exception
of
one
species
discovered
by
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
Dr
.
Dawson
in
the
carboniferous
strata
of
North
America
;
but
now
land
shells
have
been
found
in
the
lias
.
In
regard
to
mammiferous
remains
,
a
glance
at
the
historical
table
published
in
Lyell's
Manual
will
bring
home
the
truth
,
how
accidental
and
rare
is
their
preservation
,
far
better
than
pages
of
detail
.
Nor
is
their
rarity
surprising
,
when
we
remember
how
large
a
proportion
of
the
bones
of
tertiary
mammals
have
been
discovered
either
in
caves
or
in
lacustrine
deposits
;
and
that
not
a
cave
or
true
lacustrine
bed
is
known
belonging
to
the
age
of
our
secondary
or
palaeozoic
formations
.
But
the
imperfection
in
the
geological
record
largely
results
from
another
and
more
important
cause
than
any
of
the
foregoing
;
namely
,
from
the
several
formations
being
separated
from
each
other
by
wide
intervals
of
time
.
This
doctrine
has
been
emphatically
admitted
by
many
geologists
and
palaeontologists
,
who
,
like
E
.
Forbes
,
entirely
disbelieve
in
the
change
of
species
.
When
we
see
the
formations
tabulated
in
written
works
,
or
when
we
follow
them
in
nature
,
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
believing
that
they
are
closely
consecutive
.
But
we
know
,
for
instance
,
from
Sir
R
.
Murchison's
great
work
on
Russia
,
what
wide
gaps
there
are
in
that
country
between
the
superimposed
formations
;
so
it
is
in
North
America
,
and
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
.
The
most
skilful
geologist
if
his
attention
had
been
confined
exclusively
to
these
large
territories
,
would
never
have
suspected
that
,
during
the
periods
which
were
blank
and
barren
in
his
own
country
,
great
piles
of
sediment
,
charged
with
new
and
peculiar
forms
of
life
,
had
elsewhere
been
accumulated
.
And
if
,
in
each
separate
territory
,
hardly
any
idea
can
be
formed
of
the
length
of
time
which
has
elapsed
between
the
consecutive
formations
,
we
may
infer
that
this
could
nowhere
be
ascertained
.
The
frequent
and
great
changes
in
the
mineralogical
composition
of
consecutive
formations
,
generally
implying
great
changes
in
the
geography
of
the
surrounding
lands
,
whence
the
sediment
was
derived
,
accord
with
the
belief
of
vast
intervals
of
time
having
elapsed
between
each
formation
.
We
can
,
I
think
,
see
why
the
geological
formations
of
each
region
are
almost
invariably
intermittent
;
that
is
,
have
not
followed
each
other
in
close
sequence
.
Scarcely
any
fact
struck
me
more
when
examining
many
hundred
miles
of
the
South
American
coasts
,
which
have
been
upraised
several
hundred
feet
within
the
recent
period
,
than
the
absence
of
any
recent
deposits
sufficiently
extensive
to
last
for
even
a
short
geological
period
.
Along
the
whole
west
coast
,
which
is
inhabited
by
a
peculiar
marine
fauna
,
tertiary
beds
are
so
poorly
developed
,
that
no
record
of
several
successive
and
peculiar
marine
faunas
will
probably
be
preserved
to
a
distant
age
.
A
little
reflection
will
explain
why
,
along
the
rising
coast
of
the
western
side
of
South
America
,
no
extensive
formations
with
recent
or
tertiary
remains
can
anywhere
be
found
,
though
the
supply
of
sediment
must
for
ages
have
been
great
,
from
the
enormous
degradation
of
the
coast
rocks
and
from
muddy
streams
entering
the
sea
.
The
explanation
,
no
doubt
,
is
,
that
the
littoral
and
sub
littoral
deposits
are
continually
worn
away
,
as
soon
as
they
are
brought
up
by
the
slow
and
gradual
rising
of
the
land
within
the
grinding
action
of
the
coast
waves
.
We
may
,
I
think
,
conclude
that
sediment
must
be
accumulated
in
extremely
thick
,
solid
,
or
extensive
masses
,
in
order
to
withstand
the
incessant
action
of
the
waves
,
when
first
upraised
and
during
successive
oscillations
of
level
as
well
as
the
subsequent
subaerial
degradation
.
Such
thick
and
extensive
accumulations
of
sediment
may
be
formed
in
two
ways
;
either
in
profound
depths
of
the
sea
,
in
which
case
the
bottom
will
not
be
inhabited
by
so
many
and
such
varied
forms
of
life
,
as
the
more
shallow
seas
;
and
the
mass
when
upraised
will
give
an
imperfect
record
of
the
organisms
which
existed
in
the
neighbourhood
during
the
period
of
its
accumulation
.
Or
,
sediment
may
be
deposited
to
any
thickness
and
extent
over
a
shallow
bottom
,
if
it
continue
slowly
to
subside
.
In
this
latter
case
,
as
long
as
the
rate
of
subsidence
and
the
supply
of
sediment
nearly
balance
each
other
,
the
sea
will
remain
shallow
and
favourable
for
many
and
varied
forms
,
and
thus
a
rich
fossiliferous
formation
,
thick
enough
,
when
upraised
,
to
resist
a
large
amount
of
denudation
,
may
be
formed
.
I
am
convinced
that
nearly
all
our
ancient
formations
,
which
are
throughout
the
greater
part
of
their
thickness
rich
in
fossils
,
have
thus
been
formed
during
subsidence
.
Since
publishing
my
views
on
this
subject
in
1845
,
I
have
watched
the
progress
of
geology
,
and
have
been
surprised
to
note
how
author
after
author
,
in
treating
of
this
or
that
great
formation
,
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
accumulated
during
subsidence
.
I
may
add
,
that
the
only
ancient
tertiary
formation
on
the
west
coast
of
South
America
,
which
has
been
bulky
enough
to
resist
such
degradation
as
it
has
yet
suffered
,
but
which
will
hardly
last
to
a
distant
geological
age
,
was
deposited
during
a
downward
oscillation
of
level
,
and
thus
gained
considerable
thickness
.
All
geological
facts
tell
us
plainly
that
each
area
has
undergone
slow
oscillations
of
level
,
and
apparently
these
oscillations
have
affected
wide
spaces
.
Consequently
,
formations
rich
in
fossils
and
sufficiently
thick
and
extensive
to
resist
subsequent
degradation
,
will
have
been
formed
over
wide
spaces
during
periods
of
subsidence
,
but
only
where
the
supply
of
sediment
was
sufficient
to
keep
the
sea
shallow
and
to
embed
and
preserve
the
remains
before
they
had
time
to
decay
.
On
the
other
hand
,
as
long
as
the
bed
of
the
sea
remains
stationary
,
thick
deposits
cannot
have
been
accumulated
in
the
shallow
parts
,
which
are
the
most
favourable
to
life
.
Still
less
can
this
have
happened
during
the
alternate
periods
of
elevation
;
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
the
beds
which
were
then
accumulated
will
generally
have
been
destroyed
by
being
upraised
and
brought
within
the
limits
of
the
coast
action
.
These
remarks
apply
chiefly
to
littoral
and
sub
littoral
deposits
.
In
the
case
of
an
extensive
and
shallow
sea
,
such
as
that
within
a
large
part
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
,
where
the
depth
varies
from
30
or
40
to
60
fathoms
,
a
widely
extended
formation
might
be
formed
during
a
period
of
elevation
,
and
yet
not
suffer
excessively
from
denudation
during
its
slow
upheaval
;
but
the
thickness
of
the
formation
could
not
be
great
,
for
owing
to
the
elevatory
movement
it
would
be
less
than
the
depth
in
which
it
was
formed
;
nor
would
the
deposit
be
much
consolidated
,
nor
be
capped
by
overlying
formations
,
so
that
it
would
run
a
good
chance
of
being
worn
away
by
atmospheric
degradation
and
by
the
action
of
the
sea
during
subsequent
oscillations
of
level
.
It
has
,
however
,
been
suggested
by
Mr
.
Hopkins
,
that
if
one
part
of
the
area
,
after
rising
and
before
being
denuded
,
subsided
,
the
deposit
formed
during
the
rising
movement
,
though
not
thick
,
might
afterwards
become
protected
by
fresh
accumulations
,
and
thus
be
preserved
for
a
long
period
.
Mr
.
Hopkins
also
expresses
his
belief
that
sedimentary
beds
of
considerable
horizontal
extent
have
rarely
been
completely
destroyed
.
But
all
geologists
,
excepting
the
few
who
believe
that
our
present
metamorphic
schists
and
plutonic
rocks
once
formed
the
primordial
nucleus
of
the
globe
,
will
admit
that
these
latter
rocks
have
been
stript
of
their
coverings
to
an
enormous
extent
.
For
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
such
rocks
could
have
been
solidified
and
crystallized
whilst
uncovered
;
but
if
the
metamorphic
action
occurred
at
profound
depths
of
the
ocean
,
the
former
protecting
mantle
of
rock
may
not
have
been
very
thick
.
Admitting
then
that
gneiss
,
mica
schist
,
granite
,
diorite
,
&c
,
were
once
necessarily
covered
up
,
how
can
we
account
for
the
naked
and
extensive
areas
of
such
rocks
in
many
parts
of
the
world
,
except
on
the
belief
that
they
have
subsequently
been
completely
denuded
of
all
overlying
strata
?
That
such
extensive
areas
do
exist
cannot
be
doubted
:
the
granitic
region
of
Parime
is
described
by
Humboldt
as
being
as
least
nineteen
times
as
large
as
Switzerland
.
South
of
the
Amazon
,
Boue
colours
an
area
composed
of
rocks
of
this
nature
as
equal
to
that
of
Spain
,
France
,
Italy
,
part
of
Germany
,
and
the
British
Islands
,
all
conjoined
.
This
region
has
not
been
carefully
explored
,
but
from
the
concurrent
testimony
of
travellers
,
the
granitic
area
is
very
large
:
thus
,
von
Eschwege
gives
a
detailed
section
of
these
rocks
,
stretching
from
Rio
de
Janeiro
for
260
geographical
miles
inland
in
a
straight
line
;
and
I
travelled
for
150
miles
in
another
direction
,
and
saw
nothing
but
granitic
rocks
.
Numerous
specimens
,
collected
along
the
whole
coast
from
near
Rio
de
Janeiro
to
the
mouth
of
the
Plata
,
a
distance
of
1100
geographical
miles
,
were
examined
by
me
,
and
they
all
belonged
to
this
class
.
Inland
,
along
the
whole
northern
bank
of
the
Plata
I
saw
,
besides
modern
tertiary
beds
,
only
one
small
patch
of
slightly
metamorphosed
rock
,
which
alone
could
have
formed
a
part
of
the
original
capping
of
the
granitic
series
.
Turning
to
a
well
known
region
,
namely
,
to
the
United
States
and
Canada
,
as
shown
in
Professor
H
.
D
.
Rogers's
beautiful
map
,
I
have
estimated
the
areas
by
cutting
out
and
weighing
the
paper
,
and
I
find
that
the
metamorphic
(
excluding
"
the
semi
metamorphic
"
)
and
granitic
rocks
exceed
,
in
the
proportion
of
19
to
12
.
5
,
the
whole
of
the
newer
Palaeozoic
formations
.
In
many
regions
the
metamorphic
and
granitic
rocks
would
be
found
much
more
widely
extended
than
they
appear
to
be
,
if
all
the
sedimentary
beds
were
removed
which
rest
unconformably
on
them
,
and
which
could
not
have
formed
part
of
the
original
mantle
under
which
they
were
crystallized
.
Hence
it
is
probable
that
in
some
parts
of
the
world
whole
formations
have
been
completely
denuded
,
with
not
a
wreck
left
behind
.
One
remark
is
here
worth
a
passing
notice
.
During
periods
of
elevation
the
area
of
the
land
and
of
the
adjoining
shoal
parts
of
the
sea
will
be
increased
,
and
new
stations
will
often
be
formed
:
all
circumstances
favourable
,
as
previously
explained
,
for
the
formation
of
new
varieties
and
species
;
but
during
such
periods
there
will
generally
be
a
blank
in
the
geological
record
.
On
the
other
hand
,
during
subsidence
,
the
inhabited
area
and
number
of
inhabitants
will
decrease
(
excepting
on
the
shores
of
a
continent
when
first
broken
up
into
an
archipelago
)
,
and
consequently
during
subsidence
,
though
there
will
be
much
extinction
,
few
new
varieties
or
species
will
be
formed
;
and
it
is
during
these
very
periods
of
subsidence
,
that
the
deposits
which
are
richest
in
fossils
have
been
accumulated
.
On
the
Absence
of
Numerous
Intermediate
Varieties
in
any
Single
Formation
From
these
several
considerations
,
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
geological
record
,
viewed
as
a
whole
,
is
extremely
imperfect
;
but
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
any
one
formation
,
it
becomes
much
more
difficult
to
understand
why
we
do
not
therein
find
closely
graduated
varieties
between
the
allied
species
which
lived
at
its
commencement
and
at
its
close
.
Several
cases
are
on
record
of
the
same
species
presenting
varieties
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
;
thus
,
Trautschold
gives
a
number
of
instances
with
ammonites
;
and
Hilgendorf
has
described
a
most
curious
case
of
ten
graduated
forms
of
Planorbis
multiformis
in
the
successive
beds
of
a
fresh
water
formation
in
Switzerland
.
Although
each
formation
has
indisputably
required
a
vast
number
of
years
for
its
deposition
,
several
reasons
can
be
given
why
each
should
not
commonly
include
a
graduated
series
of
links
between
the
species
which
lived
at
its
commencement
and
close
;
but
I
cannot
assign
due
proportional
weight
to
the
following
considerations
.
Although
each
formation
may
mark
a
very
long
lapse
of
years
,
each
probably
is
short
compared
with
the
period
requisite
to
change
one
species
into
another
.
I
am
aware
that
two
palaeontologists
,
whose
opinions
are
worthy
of
much
deference
,
namely
Bronn
and
Woodward
,
have
concluded
that
the
average
duration
of
each
formation
is
twice
or
thrice
as
long
as
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
.
But
insuperable
difficulties
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
prevent
us
from
coming
to
any
just
conclusion
on
this
head
.
When
we
see
a
species
first
appearing
in
the
middle
of
any
formation
,
it
would
be
rash
in
the
extreme
to
infer
that
it
had
not
elsewhere
previously
existed
.
So
again
when
we
find
a
species
disappearing
before
the
last
layers
have
been
deposited
,
it
would
be
equally
rash
to
suppose
that
it
then
became
extinct
.
We
forget
how
small
the
area
of
Europe
is
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
world
;
nor
have
the
several
stages
of
the
same
formation
throughout
Europe
been
correlated
with
perfect
accuracy
.
We
may
safely
infer
that
with
marine
animals
of
all
kinds
there
has
been
a
large
amount
of
migration
due
to
climatal
and
other
changes
;
and
when
we
see
a
species
first
appearing
in
any
formation
,
the
probability
is
that
it
only
then
first
immigrated
into
that
area
.
It
is
well
known
,
for
instance
,
that
several
species
appear
somewhat
earlier
in
the
palaeozoic
beds
of
North
America
than
in
those
of
Europe
;
time
having
apparently
been
required
for
their
migration
from
the
American
to
the
European
seas
.
In
examining
the
latest
deposits
in
various
quarters
of
the
world
,
it
has
everywhere
been
noted
,
that
some
few
still
existing
species
are
common
in
the
deposit
,
but
have
become
extinct
in
the
immediately
surrounding
sea
;
or
,
conversely
that
some
are
now
abundant
in
the
neighbouring
sea
,
but
are
rare
or
absent
in
this
particular
deposit
.
It
is
an
excellent
lesson
to
reflect
on
the
ascertained
amount
of
migration
of
the
inhabitants
of
Europe
during
the
glacial
epoch
,
which
forms
only
a
part
of
one
whole
geological
period
;
and
likewise
to
reflect
on
the
changes
of
level
,
on
the
extreme
change
of
climate
,
and
on
the
great
lapse
of
time
,
all
included
within
this
same
glacial
period
.
Yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
,
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
,
sedimentary
deposits
,
including
fossil
remains
,
have
gone
on
accumulating
within
the
same
area
during
the
whole
of
this
period
.
It
is
not
,
for
instance
,
probable
that
sediment
was
deposited
during
the
whole
of
the
glacial
period
near
the
mouth
of
the
Mississippi
,
within
that
limit
of
depth
at
which
marine
animals
can
best
flourish
:
for
we
know
that
great
geographical
changes
occurred
in
other
parts
of
America
during
this
space
of
time
.
When
such
beds
as
were
deposited
in
shallow
water
near
the
mouth
of
the
Mississippi
during
some
part
of
the
glacial
period
shall
have
been
upraised
,
organic
remains
will
probably
first
appear
and
disappear
at
different
levels
,
owing
to
the
migrations
of
species
and
to
geographical
changes
.
And
in
the
distant
future
,
a
geologist
,
examining
these
beds
,
would
be
tempted
to
conclude
that
the
average
duration
of
life
of
the
embedded
fossils
had
been
less
than
that
of
the
glacial
period
,
instead
of
having
been
really
far
greater
,
that
is
,
extending
from
before
the
glacial
epoch
to
the
present
day
.
In
order
to
get
a
perfect
gradation
between
two
forms
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
,
the
deposit
must
have
gone
on
continuously
accumulating
during
a
long
period
,
sufficient
for
the
slow
process
of
modification
;
hence
the
deposit
must
be
a
very
thick
one
;
and
the
species
,
undergoing
change
must
have
lived
in
the
same
district
throughout
the
whole
time
.
But
we
have
seen
that
a
thick
formation
,
fossiliferous
throughout
its
entire
thickness
,
can
accumulate
only
during
a
period
of
subsidence
;
and
to
keep
the
depth
approximately
the
same
,
which
is
necessary
that
the
same
marine
species
may
live
on
the
same
space
,
the
supply
of
sediment
must
nearly
counterbalance
the
amount
of
subsidence
.
But
this
same
movement
of
subsidence
will
tend
to
submerge
the
area
whence
the
sediment
is
derived
,
and
thus
diminish
the
supply
,
whilst
the
downward
movement
continues
.
In
fact
,
this
nearly
exact
balancing
between
the
supply
of
sediment
and
the
amount
of
subsidence
is
probably
a
rare
contingency
;
for
it
has
been
observed
by
more
than
one
palaeontologist
,
that
very
thick
deposits
are
usually
barren
of
organic
remains
,
except
near
their
upper
or
lower
limits
.
It
would
seem
that
each
separate
formation
,
like
the
whole
pile
of
formations
in
any
country
,
has
generally
been
intermittent
in
its
accumulation
.
When
we
see
,
as
is
so
often
the
case
,
a
formation
composed
of
beds
of
widely
different
mineralogical
composition
,
we
may
reasonably
suspect
that
the
process
of
deposition
has
been
more
or
less
interrupted
.
Nor
will
the
closest
inspection
of
a
formation
give
us
any
idea
of
the
length
of
time
which
its
deposition
may
have
consumed
.
Many
instances
could
be
given
of
beds
only
a
few
feet
in
thickness
,
representing
formations
,
which
are
elsewhere
thousands
of
feet
in
thickness
,
and
which
must
have
required
an
enormous
period
for
their
accumulation
;
yet
no
one
ignorant
of
this
fact
would
have
even
suspected
the
vast
lapse
of
time
represented
by
the
thinner
formation
.
Many
cases
could
be
given
of
the
lower
beds
of
a
formation
having
been
upraised
,
denuded
,
submerged
,
and
then
re
covered
by
the
upper
beds
of
the
same
formation
,
facts
,
showing
what
wide
,
yet
easily
overlooked
,
intervals
have
occurred
in
its
accumulation
.
In
other
cases
we
have
the
plainest
evidence
in
great
fossilised
trees
,
still
standing
upright
as
they
grew
,
of
many
long
intervals
of
time
and
changes
of
level
during
the
process
of
deposition
,
which
would
not
have
been
suspected
,
had
not
the
trees
been
preserved
:
thus
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
Dr
.
Dawson
found
carboniferous
beds
1400
feet
thick
in
Nova
Scotia
,
with
ancient
root
bearing
strata
,
one
above
the
other
at
no
less
than
sixty
eight
different
levels
.
Hence
,
when
the
same
species
occurs
at
the
bottom
,
middle
,
and
top
of
a
formation
,
the
probability
is
that
it
has
not
lived
on
the
same
spot
during
the
whole
period
of
deposition
,
but
has
disappeared
and
reappeared
,
perhaps
many
times
,
during
the
same
geological
period
.
Consequently
if
it
were
to
undergo
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
during
the
deposition
of
any
one
geological
formation
,
a
section
would
not
include
all
the
fine
intermediate
gradations
which
must
on
our
theory
have
existed
,
but
abrupt
,
though
perhaps
slight
,
changes
of
form
.
It
is
all
important
to
remember
that
naturalists
have
no
golden
rule
by
which
to
distinguish
species
and
varieties
;
they
grant
some
little
variability
to
each
species
,
but
when
they
meet
with
a
somewhat
greater
amount
of
difference
between
any
two
forms
,
they
rank
both
as
species
,
unless
they
are
enabled
to
connect
them
together
by
the
closest
intermediate
gradations
;
and
this
,
from
the
reasons
just
assigned
,
we
can
seldom
hope
to
effect
in
any
one
geological
section
.
Supposing
B
and
C
to
be
two
species
,
and
a
third
,
A
,
to
be
found
in
an
older
and
underlying
bed
;
even
if
A
were
strictly
intermediate
between
B
and
C
,
it
would
simply
be
ranked
as
a
third
and
distinct
species
,
unless
at
the
same
time
it
could
be
closely
connected
by
intermediate
varieties
with
either
one
or
both
forms
.
Nor
should
it
be
forgotten
,
as
before
explained
,
that
A
might
be
the
actual
progenitor
of
B
and
C
,
and
yet
would
not
necessarily
be
strictly
intermediate
between
them
in
all
respects
.
So
that
we
might
obtain
the
parent
species
,
and
its
several
modified
descendants
from
the
lower
and
upper
beds
of
the
same
formation
,
and
unless
we
obtained
numerous
transitional
gradations
,
we
should
not
recognise
their
blood
relationship
,
and
should
consequently
rank
them
as
distinct
species
.
It
is
notorious
on
what
excessively
slight
differences
many
palaeontologists
have
founded
their
species
;
and
they
do
this
the
more
readily
if
the
specimens
come
from
different
substages
of
the
same
formation
.
Some
experienced
conchologists
are
now
sinking
many
of
the
very
fine
species
of
D'Orbigny
and
others
into
the
rank
of
varieties
;
and
on
this
view
we
do
find
the
kind
of
evidence
of
change
which
on
the
theory
we
ought
to
find
.
Look
again
at
the
later
tertiary
deposits
,
which
include
many
shells
believed
by
the
majority
of
naturalists
to
be
identical
with
existing
species
;
but
some
excellent
naturalists
as
Agassiz
and
Pictet
,
maintain
that
all
these
tertiary
species
are
specifically
distinct
,
though
the
distinction
is
admitted
to
be
very
slight
;
so
that
here
,
unless
we
believe
that
these
eminent
naturalists
have
been
misled
by
their
imaginations
,
and
that
these
late
tertiary
species
really
present
no
difference
whatever
from
their
living
.
representatives
,
or
unless
we
admit
,
in
opposition
to
the
judgment
of
most
naturalists
,
that
these
tertiary
species
are
all
truly
distinct
from
the
recent
,
we
have
evidence
of
the
frequent
occurrence
of
slight
modifications
of
the
kind
required
.
It
we
look
to
rather
wider
intervals
of
time
,
namely
,
to
distinct
but
consecutive
stages
of
the
same
great
formation
,
we
find
that
the
embedded
fossils
,
though
universally
ranked
as
specifically
different
,
yet
are
far
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
are
the
species
found
in
more
widely
separated
formations
;
so
that
here
again
we
have
undoubted
evidence
of
change
in
the
direction
required
by
the
theory
;
but
to
this
latter
subject
I
shall
return
in
the
following
chapter
.
With
animals
and
plants
that
propagate
rapidly
and
do
not
wander
much
,
there
is
reason
to
suspect
,
as
we
have
formerly
seen
,
that
their
varieties
are
generally
at
first
local
;
and
that
such
local
varieties
do
not
spread
widely
and
supplant
their
parent
forms
until
they
have
been
modified
and
perfected
in
some
considerable
degree
.
According
to
this
view
,
the
chance
of
discovering
in
a
formation
in
any
one
country
all
the
early
stages
of
transition
between
any
two
forms
,
is
small
,
for
the
successive
changes
are
supposed
to
have
been
local
or
confined
to
some
one
spot
.
Most
marine
animals
have
a
wide
range
;
and
we
have
seen
that
with
plants
it
is
those
which
have
the
widest
range
,
that
oftenest
present
varieties
;
so
that
,
with
shells
and
other
marine
animals
,
it
is
probable
that
those
which
had
the
widest
range
,
far
exceeding
the
limits
of
the
known
geological
formations
in
Europe
,
have
oftenest
given
rise
,
first
to
local
varieties
and
ultimately
to
new
species
;
and
this
again
would
greatly
lessen
the
chance
of
our
being
able
trace
the
stages
of
transition
in
any
one
geological
formation
.
It
is
a
more
important
consideration
,
leading
to
the
same
result
,
as
lately
insisted
on
by
Dr
.
Falconer
,
namely
,
that
the
period
during
which
each
species
underwent
modification
,
though
long
as
measured
by
years
,
was
probably
short
in
comparison
with
that
during
which
it
remained
without
undergoing
any
change
.
It
should
not
be
forgotten
,
that
at
the
present
day
,
with
perfect
specimens
for
examination
,
two
forms
can
seldom
be
connected
by
intermediate
varieties
,
and
thus
proved
to
be
the
same
species
,
until
many
specimens
are
collected
from
many
places
;
and
with
fossil
species
this
can
rarely
be
done
.
We
shall
,
perhaps
,
best
perceive
the
improbability
of
our
being
enabled
to
connect
species
by
numerous
,
fine
,
intermediate
,
fossil
links
,
by
asking
ourselves
whether
,
for
instance
,
geologists
at
some
future
period
will
be
able
to
prove
that
our
different
breeds
of
cattle
,
sheep
,
horses
,
and
dogs
are
descended
from
a
single
stock
or
from
several
aboriginal
stocks
;
or
,
again
,
whether
certain
sea
shells
inhabiting
the
shores
of
North
America
,
which
are
ranked
by
some
conchologists
as
distinct
species
from
their
European
representatives
,
and
by
other
conchologists
as
only
varieties
,
are
really
varieties
,
or
are
,
as
it
is
called
,
specifically
distinct
.
This
could
be
effected
by
the
future
geologist
only
by
his
discovering
in
a
fossil
state
numerous
intermediate
gradations
;
and
such
success
is
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
.
It
has
been
asserted
over
and
over
again
,
by
writers
who
believe
in
the
immutability
of
species
,
that
geology
yields
no
linking
forms
.
This
assertion
,
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
,
is
certainly
erroneous
.
As
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
has
remarked
,
"
Every
species
is
a
link
between
other
allied
forms
.
"
If
we
take
a
genus
having
a
score
of
species
,
recent
and
extinct
,
and
destroy
four
fifths
of
them
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
remainder
will
stand
much
more
distinct
from
each
other
.
If
the
extreme
forms
in
the
genus
happen
to
have
been
thus
destroyed
,
the
genus
itself
will
stand
more
distinct
from
other
allied
genera
.
What
geological
research
has
not
revealed
,
is
the
former
existence
of
infinitely
numerous
gradations
,
as
fine
as
existing
varieties
,
connecting
together
nearly
all
existing
and
extinct
species
.
But
this
ought
not
to
be
expected
;
yet
this
has
been
repeatedly
advanced
as
a
most
serious
objection
against
my
views
.
It
may
be
worth
while
to
sum
up
the
foregoing
remarks
on
the
causes
of
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
under
an
imaginary
illustration
.
The
Malay
Archipelago
is
about
the
size
of
Europe
from
the
North
Cape
to
the
Mediterranean
,
and
from
Britain
to
Russia
;
and
therefore
equals
all
the
geological
formations
which
have
been
examined
with
any
accuracy
,
excepting
those
of
the
United
States
of
America
.
I
fully
agree
with
Mr
.
Godwin
Austen
,
that
the
present
condition
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
,
with
its
numerous
large
islands
separated
by
wide
and
shallow
seas
,
probably
represents
the
former
state
of
Europe
,
whilst
most
of
our
formations
were
accumulating
.
The
Malay
Archipelago
is
one
of
the
richest
regions
in
organic
beings
;
yet
if
all
the
species
were
to
be
collected
which
have
ever
lived
there
,
how
imperfectly
would
they
represent
the
natural
history
of
the
world!
But
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
terrestrial
productions
of
the
archipelago
would
be
preserved
in
an
extremely
imperfect
manner
in
the
formations
which
we
suppose
to
be
there
accumulating
.
Not
many
of
the
strictly
littoral
animals
,
or
of
those
which
lived
on
naked
submarine
rocks
,
would
be
embedded
;
and
those
embedded
in
gravel
or
sand
would
not
endure
to
a
distant
epoch
.
Wherever
sediment
did
not
accumulate
on
the
bed
of
the
sea
,
or
where
it
did
not
accumulate
at
a
sufficient
rate
to
protect
organic
bodies
from
decay
,
no
remains
could
be
preserved
.
Formations
rich
in
fossils
of
many
kinds
,
and
of
thickness
sufficient
to
last
to
an
age
as
distant
in
futurity
as
the
secondary
formations
lie
in
the
past
,
would
generally
be
formed
in
the
archipelago
only
during
periods
of
subsidence
.
These
periods
of
subsidence
would
be
separated
from
each
other
by
immense
intervals
of
time
,
during
which
the
area
would
be
either
stationary
or
rising
;
whilst
rising
,
the
fossiliferous
formations
on
the
steeper
shores
would
be
destroyed
,
almost
as
soon
as
accumulated
,
by
the
incessant
coast
action
,
as
we
now
see
on
the
shores
of
South
America
.
Even
throughout
the
extensive
and
shallow
seas
within
the
archipelago
,
sedimentary
beds
could
hardly
be
accumulated
of
great
thickness
during
the
periods
of
elevation
,
or
become
capped
and
protected
by
subsequent
deposits
,
so
as
to
have
a
good
chance
of
enduring
to
a
very
distant
future
.
During
the
periods
of
subsidence
,
there
would
probably
be
much
extinction
of
life
;
during
the
periods
of
elevation
,
there
would
be
much
variation
,
but
the
geological
record
would
then
be
less
perfect
.
It
may
be
doubted
whether
the
duration
of
any
one
great
period
of
subsidence
over
the
whole
or
part
of
the
archipelago
,
together
with
a
contemporaneous
accumulation
of
sediment
,
would
exceed
the
average
duration
of
the
same
specific
forms
;
and
these
contingencies
are
indispensable
for
the
preservation
of
all
the
transitional
gradations
between
any
two
or
more
species
.
If
such
gradations
were
not
all
fully
preserved
,
transitional
varieties
would
merely
appear
as
so
many
new
,
though
closely
allied
species
.
It
is
also
probable
that
each
great
period
of
subsidence
would
be
interrupted
by
oscillations
of
level
,
and
that
slight
climatal
changes
would
intervene
during
such
lengthy
periods
;
and
in
these
cases
the
inhabitants
of
the
archipelago
would
migrate
,
and
no
closely
consecutive
record
of
their
modifications
could
be
preserved
in
any
one
formation
.
Very
many
of
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
archipelago
now
range
thousands
of
miles
beyond
its
confines
;
and
analogy
plainly
leads
to
the
belief
that
it
would
be
chiefly
these
far
ranging
species
,
though
only
some
of
them
,
which
would
oftenest
produce
new
varieties
;
and
the
varieties
would
at
first
be
local
or
confined
to
one
place
,
but
if
possessed
of
any
decided
advantage
,
or
when
further
modified
and
improved
,
they
would
slowly
spread
and
supplant
their
parent
forms
.
When
such
varieties
returned
to
their
ancient
homes
,
as
they
would
differ
from
their
former
state
in
a
nearly
uniform
,
though
perhaps
extremely
slight
degree
,
and
as
they
would
be
found
embedded
in
slightly
different
sub
stages
of
the
same
formation
,
they
would
,
according
to
the
principles
followed
by
many
palaeontologists
,
be
ranked
as
new
and
distinct
species
.
If
then
there
be
some
degree
of
truth
in
these
remarks
,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
to
find
,
in
our
geological
formations
,
an
infinite
number
of
those
fine
transitional
forms
which
,
on
our
theory
,
have
connected
all
the
past
and
present
species
of
the
same
group
into
one
long
and
branching
chain
of
life
.
We
ought
only
to
look
for
a
few
links
,
and
such
assuredly
we
do
find
some
more
distantly
,
some
more
closely
,
related
to
each
other
;
and
these
links
,
let
them
be
ever
so
close
,
if
found
in
different
stages
of
the
same
formation
,
would
,
by
many
palaeontologists
,
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
.
But
I
do
not
pretend
that
I
should
ever
have
suspected
how
poor
was
the
record
in
the
best
preserved
geological
sections
,
had
not
the
absence
of
innumerable
transitional
links
between
the
species
which
lived
at
the
commencement
and
close
of
each
formation
,
pressed
so
hardly
on
my
theory
.
On
the
sudden
Appearance
of
whole
Groups
of
allied
Species
The
abrupt
manner
in
which
whole
groups
of
species
suddenly
appear
in
certain
formations
,
has
been
urged
by
several
palaeontologists
for
instance
,
by
Agassiz
,
Pictet
,
and
Sedgwick
as
a
fatal
objection
to
the
belief
in
the
transmutation
of
species
.
If
numerous
species
,
belonging
to
the
same
genera
or
families
,
have
really
started
into
life
at
once
,
the
fact
would
be
fatal
to
the
theory
of
evolution
through
natural
selection
.
For
the
development
by
this
means
of
a
group
of
forms
,
all
of
which
are
descended
from
some
one
progenitor
,
must
have
been
an
extremely
slow
process
;
and
the
progenitors
must
have
lived
long
before
their
modified
descendants
.
But
we
continually
overrate
the
perfection
of
the
geological
record
,
and
falsely
infer
,
because
certain
genera
or
families
have
not
been
found
beneath
a
certain
stage
,
that
they
did
not
exist
before
that
stage
.
In
all
cases
positive
palaeontological
evidence
may
be
implicitly
trusted
;
negative
evidence
is
worthless
,
as
experience
has
so
often
shown
.
We
continually
forget
how
large
the
world
is
,
compared
with
the
area
over
which
our
geological
formations
have
been
carefully
examined
;
we
forget
that
groups
of
species
may
elsewhere
have
long
existed
,
and
have
slowly
multiplied
,
before
they
invaded
the
ancient
archipelagoes
of
Europe
and
the
United
States
.
We
do
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
intervals
of
time
which
have
elapsed
between
our
consecutive
formations
,
longer
perhaps
in
many
cases
than
the
time
required
for
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
.
These
intervals
will
have
given
time
for
the
multiplication
of
species
from
some
one
parent
form
:
and
in
the
succeeding
formation
,
such
groups
or
species
will
appear
as
if
suddenly
created
.
I
may
here
recall
a
remark
formerly
made
,
namely
,
that
it
might
require
a
long
succession
of
ages
to
adapt
an
organism
to
some
new
and
peculiar
line
of
life
,
for
instance
,
to
fly
through
the
air
;
and
consequently
that
the
transitional
forms
would
often
long
remain
confined
to
some
one
region
;
but
that
,
when
this
adaptation
had
once
been
effected
,
and
a
few
species
had
thus
acquired
a
great
advantage
over
other
organisms
,
a
comparatively
short
time
would
be
necessary
to
produce
many
divergent
forms
,
which
would
spread
rapidly
and
widely
,
throughout
the
world
.
Professor
Pictet
,
in
his
excellent
review
of
this
work
,
in
commenting
on
early
transitional
forms
,
and
taking
birds
as
an
illustration
,
cannot
see
how
the
successive
modifications
of
the
anterior
limbs
of
a
supposed
prototype
could
possibly
have
been
of
any
advantage
.
But
look
at
the
penguins
of
the
Southern
Ocean
;
have
not
these
birds
their
front
limbs
in
this
precise
intermediate
state
of
"
neither
true
arms
nor
true
wings
"
?
Yet
these
birds
hold
their
place
victoriously
in
the
battle
for
life
;
for
they
exist
in
infinite
numbers
and
of
many
kinds
.
I
do
not
suppose
that
we
here
see
the
real
transitional
grades
through
which
the
wings
of
birds
have
passed
;
but
what
special
difficulty
is
there
in
believing
that
it
might
profit
the
modified
descendants
of
the
penguin
,
first
to
become
enabled
to
flap
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
like
the
logger
headed
duck
,
and
ultimately
to
rise
from
its
surface
and
glide
through
the
air
?
I
will
now
give
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
the
foregoing
remarks
,
and
to
show
how
liable
we
are
to
error
in
supposing
that
whole
groups
of
species
have
suddenly
been
produced
.
Even
in
so
short
an
interval
as
that
between
the
first
and
second
editions
of
Pictet's
great
work
on
Palaeontology
,
published
in
1844
46
and
in
1853
57
,
the
conclusions
on
the
first
appearance
and
disappearance
of
several
groups
of
animals
have
been
considerably
modified
;
and
a
third
edition
would
require
still
further
changes
.
I
may
recall
the
well
known
fact
that
in
geological
treatises
,
published
not
many
years
ago
,
mammals
were
always
spoken
of
as
having
abruptly
come
in
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
.
And
now
one
of
the
richest
known
accumulations
of
fossil
mammals
belongs
to
the
middle
of
the
secondary
series
;
and
true
mammals
have
been
discovered
in
the
new
red
sandstone
at
nearly
the
commencement
of
this
great
series
.
Cuvier
used
to
urge
that
no
monkey
occurred
in
any
tertiary
stratum
;
but
now
extinct
species
have
been
discovered
in
India
,
South
America
and
in
Europe
,
as
far
back
as
the
miocene
stage
.
Had
it
not
been
for
the
rare
accident
of
the
preservation
of
the
footsteps
in
the
new
red
sandstone
of
the
United
States
,
who
would
have
ventured
to
suppose
that
no
less
than
at
least
thirty
different
bird
like
animals
,
some
of
gigantic
size
,
existed
during
that
period
?
Not
a
fragment
of
bone
has
been
discovered
in
these
beds
.
Not
long
ago
,
palaeontologists
maintained
that
the
whole
class
of
birds
came
suddenly
into
existence
during
the
eocene
period
;
but
now
we
know
,
on
the
authority
of
Professor
Owen
,
that
a
bird
certainly
lived
during
the
deposition
of
the
upper
greensand
;
and
still
more
recently
,
that
strange
bird
,
the
Archeopteryx
,
with
a
long
lizard
like
tail
,
bearing
a
pair
of
feathers
on
each
joint
,
and
with
its
wings
furnished
with
two
free
claws
,
has
been
discovered
in
the
oolitic
slates
of
Solenhofen
.
Hardly
any
recent
discovery
shows
more
forcibly
than
this
,
how
little
we
as
yet
know
of
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
world
.
I
may
give
another
instance
,
which
,
from
having
passed
under
my
own
eyes
,
has
much
struck
me
.
In
a
memoir
On
Fossil
Sessile
Cirripedes
,
I
stated
that
,
from
the
large
number
of
existing
and
extinct
tertiary
species
;
from
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
the
individuals
of
many
species
all
over
the
world
,
from
the
Arctic
regions
to
the
equator
,
inhabiting
various
zones
of
depths
from
the
upper
tidal
limits
to
50
fathoms
;
from
the
perfect
manner
in
which
specimens
are
preserved
in
the
oldest
tertiary
beds
;
from
the
ease
with
which
even
a
fragment
of
a
valve
can
be
recognised
;
from
all
these
circumstances
,
I
inferred
that
,
had
sessile
cirripedes
existed
during
the
secondary
periods
,
they
would
certainly
have
been
preserved
and
discovered
;
and
as
not
one
species
had
then
been
discovered
in
beds
of
this
age
,
I
concluded
that
this
great
group
had
been
suddenly
developed
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
.
This
was
a
sore
trouble
to
me
,
adding
as
I
then
thought
one
more
instance
of
the
abrupt
appearance
of
a
great
group
of
species
.
But
my
work
had
hardly
been
published
,
when
a
skilful
palaeontologist
,
M
.
Bosquet
,
sent
me
a
drawing
of
a
perfect
specimen
of
an
unmistakable
sessile
cirripede
,
which
he
had
himself
extracted
from
the
chalk
of
Belgium
.
And
,
as
if
to
make
the
case
as
striking
as
possible
,
this
cirripede
was
a
Chthamalus
,
a
very
common
,
large
,
and
ubiquitous
genus
,
of
which
not
one
species
has
as
yet
been
found
even
in
any
tertiary
stratum
.
Still
more
recently
,
a
Pyrgoma
,
a
member
of
a
distinct
subfamily
of
sessile
cirripedes
,
has
been
discovered
by
Mr
.
Woodward
in
the
upper
chalk
;
so
that
we
now
have
abundant
evidence
of
the
existence
of
this
group
of
animals
during
the
secondary
period
.
The
case
most
frequently
insisted
on
by
palaeontologists
of
the
apparently
sudden
appearance
of
a
whole
group
of
species
,
is
that
of
the
teleostean
fishes
,
low
down
,
according
to
Agassiz
,
in
the
Chalk
period
.
This
group
includes
the
large
majority
of
existing
species
.
But
certain
Jurassic
and
Triassic
forms
are
now
commonly
admitted
to
be
teleostean
;
and
even
some
palaeozoic
forms
have
thus
been
classed
by
one
high
authority
.
If
the
teleosteans
had
really
appeared
suddenly
in
the
northern
hemisphere
at
the
commencement
of
the
chalk
formation
the
fact
would
have
been
highly
remarkable
;
but
it
would
not
have
formed
an
insuperable
difficulty
,
unless
it
could
likewise
have
been
shown
that
at
the
same
period
the
species
were
suddenly
and
simultaneously
developed
in
other
quarters
of
the
world
.
It
is
almost
superfluous
to
remark
that
hardly
any
fossil
fish
are
known
from
south
of
the
equator
;
and
by
running
through
Pictet's
Palaeontology
it
will
be
seen
that
very
few
species
are
known
from
several
formations
in
Europe
.
Some
few
families
of
fish
now
have
a
confined
range
;
the
teleostean
fishes
might
formerly
have
had
a
similarly
confined
range
,
and
after
having
been
largely
developed
in
some
one
sea
,
have
spread
widely
.
Nor
have
we
any
right
to
suppose
that
the
seas
of
the
world
have
always
been
so
freely
open
from
south
to
north
as
they
are
at
present
.
Even
at
this
day
,
if
the
Malay
Archipelago
were
converted
into
land
,
the
tropical
parts
of
the
Indian
Ocean
would
form
a
large
and
perfectly
enclosed
basin
,
in
which
any
great
group
of
marine
animals
might
be
multiplied
:
and
here
they
would
remain
confined
,
until
some
of
the
species
became
adapted
to
a
cooler
climate
,
and
were
enabled
to
double
the
Southern
capes
of
Africa
or
Australia
,
and
thus
reach
other
and
distant
seas
.
From
these
considerations
,
from
our
ignorance
of
the
geology
of
other
countries
beyond
the
confines
of
Europe
and
the
United
States
,
and
from
the
revolution
in
our
palaeontological
knowledge
effected
by
the
discoveries
of
the
last
dozen
years
,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
about
as
rash
to
dogmatize
on
the
succession
of
organic
forms
throughout
the
world
,
as
it
would
be
for
a
naturalist
to
land
for
five
minutes
on
a
barren
point
in
Australia
,
and
then
to
discuss
the
number
and
range
of
its
productions
.
On
the
Sudden
Appearance
of
Groups
of
allied
Species
in
the
lowest
known
Fossiliferous
Strata
There
is
another
and
allied
difficulty
,
which
is
much
more
serious
.
I
allude
to
the
manner
in
which
species
belonging
to
several
of
the
main
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
suddenly
appear
in
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
rocks
.
Most
of
the
arguments
which
have
convinced
me
that
all
the
existing
species
of
the
same
group
are
descended
from
a
single
progenitor
,
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
earliest
known
species
.
For
instance
,
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
all
the
Cambrian
and
Silurian
trilobites
are
descended
from
some
one
crustacean
,
which
must
have
lived
long
before
the
Cambrian
age
,
and
which
probably
differed
greatly
from
any
known
animal
.
Some
of
the
most
ancient
animals
,
as
the
Nautilus
,
Lingula
,
&c
.
,
do
not
differ
much
from
living
species
;
and
it
cannot
on
our
theory
be
supposed
,
that
these
old
species
were
the
progenitors
of
all
the
species
belonging
to
the
same
groups
which
have
subsequently
appeared
,
for
they
are
not
in
any
degree
intermediate
in
character
.
Consequently
,
if
the
theory
be
true
,
it
is
indisputable
that
before
the
lowest
Cambrian
stratum
was
deposited
,
long
periods
elapsed
,
as
long
as
,
or
probably
far
longer
than
,
the
whole
interval
from
the
Cambrian
age
to
the
present
day
;
and
that
during
these
vast
periods
the
world
swarmed
with
living
creatures
.
Here
we
encounter
a
formidable
objection
;
for
it
seems
doubtful
whether
the
earth
,
in
a
fit
state
for
the
habitation
of
living
creatures
,
has
lasted
long
enough
.
Sir
W
.
Thompson
concludes
that
the
consolidation
of
the
crust
can
hardly
have
occurred
less
than
20
or
more
than
400
million
years
ago
,
but
probably
not
less
than
98
or
more
than
200
million
years
.
These
very
wide
limits
show
how
doubtful
the
data
are
;
and
other
elements
may
have
hereafter
to
be
introduced
into
the
problem
.
Mr
.
Croll
estimates
that
about
60
million
years
have
elapsed
since
the
Cambrian
period
,
but
this
,
judging
from
the
small
amount
of
organic
change
since
the
commencement
of
the
Glacial
epoch
,
appears
a
very
short
time
for
the
many
and
great
mutations
of
life
,
which
have
certainly
occurred
since
the
Cambrian
formation
;
and
the
previous
140
million
years
can
hardly
be
considered
as
sufficient
for
the
development
of
the
varied
forms
of
life
which
already
existed
during
the
Cambrian
period
.
It
is
,
however
,
probable
,
as
Sir
William
Thompson
insists
,
that
the
world
at
a
very
early
period
was
subjected
to
more
rapid
and
violent
changes
in
its
physical
conditions
than
those
now
occurring
;
and
such
changes
would
have
tended
to
induce
changes
at
a
corresponding
rate
in
the
organisms
which
then
existed
.
To
the
question
why
we
do
not
find
rich
fossiliferous
deposits
belonging
to
these
assumed
earliest
periods
prior
to
the
Cambrian
system
,
I
can
give
no
satisfactory
answer
.
Several
eminent
geologists
,
with
Sir
R
.
Murchison
at
their
head
,
were
until
recently
convinced
that
we
beheld
in
the
organic
remains
of
the
lowest
Silurian
stratum
the
first
dawn
of
life
.
Other
highly
competent
judges
,
as
Lyell
and
E
.
Forbes
,
have
disputed
this
conclusion
.
We
should
not
forget
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
world
is
known
with
accuracy
.
Not
very
long
ago
M
.
Barrande
added
another
and
lower
stage
,
abounding
with
new
and
peculiar
species
,
beneath
the
then
known
Silurian
system
;
and
now
,
still
lower
down
in
the
Lower
Cambrian
formation
,
Mr
.
Hicks
has
found
in
South
Wales
beds
rich
in
trilobites
,
and
containing
various
molluscs
and
annelids
.
The
presence
of
phosphatic
nodules
and
bituminous
matter
,
even
in
some
of
the
lowest
azoic
rocks
,
probably
indicates
life
at
these
periods
;
and
the
existence
of
the
Eozoon
in
the
Laurentian
formation
of
Canada
is
generally
admitted
.
There
are
three
great
series
of
strata
beneath
the
Silurian
system
in
Canada
,
in
the
lowest
of
which
the
Eozoon
is
found
.
Sir
W
.
Logan
states
that
their
"
united
thickness
may
possibly
far
surpass
that
of
all
the
succeeding
rocks
,
from
the
base
of
the
palaeozoic
series
to
the
present
time
.
We
are
thus
carried
back
to
a
period
so
remote
,
that
the
appearance
of
the
so
called
primordial
fauna
(
of
Barrande
)
may
by
some
be
considered
as
a
comparatively
modern
event
.
"
The
Eozoon
belongs
to
the
most
lowly
organised
,
of
all
classes
of
animals
,
but
is
highly
organised
for
its
class
;
it
existed
in
countless
numbers
,
and
,
as
Dr
.
Dawson
has
remarked
,
certainly
preyed
on
other
minute
organic
beings
,
which
must
have
lived
in
great
numbers
.
Thus
the
words
,
which
I
wrote
in
1859
,
about
the
existence
of
living
beings
long
before
the
Cambrian
period
,
and
which
are
almost
the
same
with
those
since
used
by
Sir
W
.
Logan
,
have
proved
true
.
Nevertheless
,
the
difficulty
of
assigning
any
good
reason
for
the
absence
of
vast
piles
of
strata
rich
in
fossils
beneath
the
Cambrian
system
is
very
great
.
It
does
not
seem
probable
that
the
most
ancient
beds
have
been
quite
worn
away
by
denudation
,
or
that
their
fossils
have
been
wholly
obliterated
by
metamorphic
action
,
for
if
this
had
been
the
case
we
should
have
found
only
small
remnants
of
the
formations
next
succeeding
them
in
age
,
and
these
would
always
have
existed
in
partially
metamorphosed
condition
.
But
the
descriptions
which
we
possess
of
the
Silurian
deposits
over
immense
territories
in
Russia
and
in
North
America
,
do
not
support
the
view
,
that
the
older
a
formation
is
,
the
more
invariably
it
has
suffered
extreme
denudation
and
metamorphism
.
The
case
at
present
must
remain
inexplicable
;
and
may
be
truly
urged
as
a
valid
argument
against
the
views
here
entertained
.
To
show
that
it
may
hereafter
receive
some
explanation
,
I
will
give
the
following
hypothesis
.
From
the
nature
of
the
organic
remains
which
do
not
appear
to
have
inhabited
profound
depths
,
in
the
several
formations
of
Europe
and
of
the
United
States
;
and
from
the
amount
of
sediment
,
miles
in
thickness
,
of
which
the
formations
are
composed
,
we
may
infer
that
from
first
to
last
large
islands
or
tracts
of
land
,
whence
the
sediment
was
derived
,
occurred
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
now
existing
continents
of
Europe
and
North
America
.
This
same
view
has
since
been
maintained
by
Agassiz
and
others
.
But
we
do
not
know
what
was
the
state
of
things
in
the
intervals
between
the
several
successive
formations
;
whether
Europe
and
the
United
States
during
these
intervals
existed
as
dry
land
,
or
as
a
submarine
surface
near
land
,
on
which
sediment
was
not
deposited
,
or
as
the
bed
of
an
open
and
unfathomable
sea
.
Looking
to
the
existing
oceans
,
which
are
thrice
as
extensive
as
the
land
,
we
see
them
studded
with
many
islands
;
but
hardly
one
truly
oceanic
island
(
with
the
exception
of
New
Zealand
,
if
this
can
be
called
a
truly
oceanic
island
)
is
as
yet
known
to
afford
even
a
remnant
of
any
palaeozoic
or
secondary
formation
.
Hence
we
may
perhaps
infer
,
that
during
the
palaeozoic
and
secondary
periods
,
neither
continents
nor
continental
islands
existed
where
our
oceans
now
extend
;
for
had
they
existed
,
palaeozoic
and
secondary
formations
would
in
all
probability
have
been
accumulated
from
sediment
derived
from
their
wear
and
tear
;
and
these
would
have
been
at
least
partially
upheaved
by
the
oscillations
of
level
,
which
must
have
intervened
during
these
enormously
long
periods
.
If
then
we
may
infer
anything
from
these
facts
,
we
may
infer
that
,
where
our
oceans
now
extend
,
oceans
have
extended
from
the
remotest
period
of
which
we
have
any
record
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
that
where
continents
now
exist
,
large
tracts
of
land
have
existed
,
subjected
no
doubt
to
great
oscillations
of
level
,
since
the
Cambrian
period
.
The
coloured
map
appended
to
my
volume
on
coral
reefs
,
led
me
to
conclude
that
the
great
oceans
are
still
mainly
areas
of
subsidence
,
the
great
archipelagoes
still
areas
of
oscillations
of
level
,
and
the
continents
areas
of
elevation
.
But
we
have
no
reason
to
assume
that
things
have
thus
remained
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
.
Our
continents
seem
to
have
been
formed
by
a
preponderance
,
during
many
oscillations
of
level
,
of
the
force
of
elevation
;
but
may
not
the
areas
of
preponderant
movement
have
changed
in
the
lapse
of
ages
?
At
a
period
long
antecedent
to
the
Cambrian
epoch
,
continents
may
have
existed
where
oceans
are
now
spread
out
;
and
clear
and
open
oceans
may
have
existed
where
our
continents
now
stand
.
Nor
should
we
be
justified
in
assuming
that
if
,
for
instance
,
the
bed
of
the
Pacific
Ocean
were
now
converted
into
a
continent
we
should
there
find
sedimentary
formations
in
a
recognisable
condition
older
than
the
Cambrian
strata
,
supposing
such
to
have
been
formerly
deposited
;
for
it
might
well
happen
that
strata
which
had
subsided
some
miles
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
,
and
which
had
been
pressed
on
by
an
enormous
weight
of
super
incumbent
water
,
might
have
undergone
far
more
metamorphic
action
than
strata
which
have
always
remained
nearer
to
the
surface
.
The
immense
areas
in
some
parts
of
the
world
,
for
instance
in
South
America
,
of
naked
metamorphic
rocks
,
which
must
have
been
heated
under
great
pressure
,
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
require
some
special
explanation
;
and
we
may
perhaps
believe
that
we
see
in
these
large
areas
,
the
many
formations
long
anterior
to
the
Cambrian
epoch
in
a
completely
metamorphosed
and
denuded
condition
.
The
several
difficulties
here
discussed
,
namely
that
,
though
we
find
in
our
geological
formations
many
links
between
the
species
which
now
exist
and
which
formerly
existed
,
we
do
not
find
infinitely
numerous
fine
transitional
forms
closely
joining
them
all
together
;
the
sudden
manner
in
which
several
groups
of
species
first
appear
in
our
European
formations
;
the
almost
entire
absence
,
as
at
present
known
,
of
formations
rich
in
fossils
beneath
the
Cambrian
strata
,
are
all
undoubtedly
of
the
most
serious
nature
.
We
see
this
in
the
fact
that
the
most
eminent
palaeontologists
,
namely
Cuvier
,
Agassiz
,
Barrande
,
Pictet
,
Falconer
,
E
.
Forbes
,
&c
.
,
and
all
our
greatest
geologists
,
as
Lyell
,
Murchison
,
Sedgwick
,
&c
.
,
have
unanimously
,
often
vehemently
,
maintained
the
immutability
of
species
.
But
Sir
Charles
Lyell
now
gives
the
support
of
his
high
authority
to
the
opposite
side
;
and
most
geologists
and
palaeontologists
are
much
shaken
in
their
former
belief
.
Those
who
believe
that
the
geological
record
is
in
any
degree
perfect
,
will
undoubtedly
at
once
reject
the
theory
.
For
my
part
,
following
out
Lyell's
metaphor
,
I
look
at
the
geological
record
as
a
history
of
the
world
imperfectly
kept
,
and
written
in
a
changing
dialect
;
of
this
history
we
possess
the
last
volume
alone
,
relating
only
to
two
or
three
countries
.
Of
this
volume
,
only
here
and
there
a
short
chapter
has
been
preserved
;
and
of
each
page
,
only
here
and
there
a
few
lines
.
Each
word
of
the
slowly
changing
language
,
more
or
less
different
in
the
successive
chapters
,
may
represent
the
forms
of
life
,
which
are
entombed
in
our
consecutive
formations
,
and
which
falsely
appear
to
have
been
abruptly
introduced
.
On
this
view
,
the
difficulties
above
discussed
are
greatly
diminished
,
or
even
disappear
.
CHAPTER
XI
ON
THE
GEOLOGICAL
SUCCESSION
OF
ORGANIC
BEINGS
LET
us
now
see
whether
the
several
facts
and
laws
relating
to
the
geological
succession
of
organic
beings
accord
best
with
the
common
view
of
the
immutability
of
species
,
or
with
that
of
their
slow
and
gradual
modification
,
through
variation
and
natural
selection
.
New
species
have
appeared
very
slowly
,
one
after
another
,
both
on
the
land
and
in
the
waters
.
Lyell
has
shown
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
resist
the
evidence
on
this
head
in
the
case
of
the
several
tertiary
stages
;
and
every
year
tends
to
fill
up
the
blanks
between
the
stages
,
and
to
make
the
proportion
between
the
lost
and
existing
forms
more
gradual
.
In
some
of
the
most
recent
beds
,
though
undoubtedly
of
high
antiquity
if
measured
by
years
,
only
one
or
two
species
are
extinct
,
and
only
one
or
two
are
new
,
having
appeared
there
for
the
first
time
,
either
locally
,
or
,
as
far
as
we
know
,
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
The
secondary
formations
are
more
broken
;
but
,
as
Bronn
has
remarked
,
neither
the
appearance
nor
disappearance
of
the
many
species
embedded
in
each
formation
has
been
simultaneous
.
Species
belonging
to
different
genera
and
classes
have
not
changed
at
the
same
rate
,
or
in
the
same
degree
.
In
the
older
tertiary
beds
a
few
living
shells
may
still
be
found
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
extinct
forms
.
Falconer
has
given
a
striking
instance
of
a
similar
fact
,
for
an
existing
crocodile
is
associated
with
many
lost
mammals
and
reptiles
in
the
sub
Himalayan
deposits
.
The
Silurian
Lingula
differs
but
little
from
the
living
species
of
this
genus
;
whereas
most
of
the
other
Silurian
molluscs
and
all
the
crustaceans
have
changed
greatly
.
The
productions
of
the
land
seem
to
have
changed
at
a
quicker
rate
than
those
of
the
sea
,
of
which
a
striking
instance
has
been
observed
in
Switzerland
.
There
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
organisms
high
in
the
scale
,
change
more
quickly
than
those
that
are
low
:
though
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
.
The
amount
of
organic
change
,
as
Pictet
has
remarked
,
is
not
the
same
in
each
successive
so
called
formation
.
Yet
if
we
compare
any
but
the
most
closely
related
formations
,
all
the
species
will
be
found
to
have
undergone
some
change
.
When
a
species
has
once
disappeared
from
the
lace
of
the
earth
,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
same
identical
form
ever
reappears
.
The
strongest
apparent
exception
to
this
latter
rule
is
that
of
the
so
called
"
colonies
"
of
M
.
Barrande
,
which
intrude
for
a
period
in
the
midst
of
an
older
formation
,
and
then
allow
the
pre
existing
fauna
to
reappear
;
but
Lyell's
explanation
,
namely
,
that
it
is
a
case
of
temporary
migration
from
a
distinct
geographical
province
,
seems
satisfactory
.
These
several
facts
accord
well
with
our
theory
,
which
includes
no
fixed
law
of
development
,
causing
all
the
inhabitants
of
an
area
to
change
abruptly
,
or
simultaneously
,
or
to
an
equal
degree
.
The
process
of
modification
must
be
slow
,
and
will
generally
affect
only
a
few
species
at
the
same
time
;
for
the
variability
of
each
species
is
independent
of
that
of
all
others
.
Whether
such
variations
or
individual
differences
as
may
arise
will
be
accumulated
through
natural
selection
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
,
thus
causing
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
permanent
modification
,
will
depend
on
many
complex
contingencies
on
the
variations
being
of
a
beneficial
nature
,
on
the
freedom
of
intercrossing
,
on
the
slowly
changing
physical
conditions
of
the
country
,
on
the
immigration
of
new
colonists
,
and
on
the
nature
of
the
other
inhabitants
with
which
the
varying
species
come
into
competition
.
Hence
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
one
species
should
retain
the
same
identical
form
much
longer
than
others
;
or
,
if
changing
,
should
change
in
a
less
degree
.
We
find
similar
relations
between
the
existing
inhabitants
of
distinct
countries
;
for
instance
,
the
land
shells
and
coleopterous
insects
of
Madeira
have
come
to
differ
considerably
from
their
nearest
allies
on
the
continent
of
Europe
,
whereas
the
marine
shells
and
birds
have
remained
unaltered
.
We
can
perhaps
understand
the
apparently
quicker
rate
of
change
in
terrestrial
and
in
more
highly
organised
productions
compared
with
marine
and
lower
productions
,
by
the
more
complex
relations
of
the
higher
beings
to
their
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
,
as
explained
in
a
former
chapter
.
When
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
area
have
become
modified
and
improved
,
we
can
understand
,
on
the
principle
of
competition
,
and
from
the
all
important
relations
of
organism
to
organism
in
the
struggle
for
life
,
that
any
form
which
did
not
become
in
some
degree
modified
and
improved
,
would
be
liable
to
extermination
.
Hence
we
see
why
all
the
species
in
the
same
region
do
at
last
,
if
we
look
to
long
enough
intervals
of
time
,
become
modified
,
for
otherwise
they
would
become
extinct
.
In
members
of
the
same
class
the
average
amount
of
change
,
during
long
and
equal
periods
of
time
,
may
,
perhaps
,
be
nearly
the
same
;
but
as
the
accumulation
of
enduring
formations
,
rich
in
fossils
,
depends
on
great
masses
of
sediment
being
deposited
on
subsiding
areas
,
our
formations
have
been
almost
necessarily
accumulated
at
wide
and
irregularly
intermittent
intervals
of
time
;
consequently
the
amount
of
organic
change
exhibited
by
the
fossils
embedded
in
consecutive
formations
is
not
equal
.
Each
formation
,
on
this
view
,
does
not
mark
a
new
and
complete
act
of
creation
,
but
only
an
occasional
scene
,
taken
almost
at
hazard
,
in
an
ever
slowly
changing
drama
.
We
can
clearly
understand
why
a
species
when
once
lost
should
never
reappear
,
even
if
the
very
same
conditions
of
life
,
organic
and
inorganic
,
should
recur
.
For
though
the
offspring
of
one
species
might
be
adapted
(
and
no
doubt
this
has
occurred
in
innumerable
instances
)
to
fill
the
place
of
another
species
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
and
thus
supplant
it
;
yet
the
two
forms
the
old
and
the
new
would
not
be
identically
the
same
;
for
both
would
almost
certainly
inherit
different
characters
from
their
distinct
progenitors
;
and
organisms
already
differing
would
vary
in
a
different
manner
.
For
instance
,
it
is
possible
,
if
all
our
fantail
pigeons
were
destroyed
,
that
fanciers
might
make
a
new
breed
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
present
breed
;
but
if
the
parent
rock
pigeon
were
likewise
destroyed
,
and
under
nature
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
parent
forms
are
generally
supplanted
and
exterminated
by
their
improved
off
spring
,
it
is
incredible
that
a
fantail
,
identical
with
the
existing
breed
,
could
be
raised
from
any
other
species
of
pigeon
,
or
even
from
any
other
well
established
race
of
the
domestic
pigeon
,
for
the
successive
variations
would
almost
certainly
be
in
some
degree
different
,
and
the
newly
formed
variety
would
probably
inherit
from
its
progenitor
some
characteristic
differences
.
Groups
of
species
,
that
is
,
genera
and
families
,
follow
the
same
general
rules
in
their
appearance
and
disappearance
as
do
single
species
,
changing
more
or
less
quickly
,
and
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
.
A
group
,
when
it
has
once
disappeared
,
never
reappears
;
that
is
,
its
existence
,
as
long
as
it
lasts
,
is
continuous
.
I
am
aware
that
there
are
some
apparent
exceptions
to
this
rule
,
but
the
exceptions
are
surprisingly
few
,
so
few
that
E
.
Forbes
,
Pictet
,
and
Woodward
(
though
all
strongly
opposed
to
such
views
as
I
maintain
)
admit
its
truth
;
and
the
rule
strictly
accords
with
the
theory
.
For
all
the
species
of
the
same
group
,
however
long
it
may
have
lasted
,
are
the
modified
descendants
one
from
the
other
,
and
all
from
a
common
progenitor
.
In
the
genus
Lingula
,
for
instance
,
the
species
which
have
successively
appeared
at
all
ages
must
have
been
connected
by
an
unbroken
series
of
generations
,
from
the
lowest
Silurian
stratum
to
the
present
day
.
We
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
whole
groups
of
species
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
have
been
abruptly
developed
;
and
I
have
attempted
to
give
an
explanation
of
this
fact
,
which
if
true
would
be
fatal
to
my
views
.
But
such
cases
are
certainly
exceptional
;
the
general
rule
being
a
gradual
increase
in
number
,
until
the
group
reaches
its
maximum
,
and
then
,
sooner
or
later
,
a
gradual
decrease
.
If
the
number
of
the
species
included
within
a
genus
,
or
the
number
of
the
genera
within
a
family
,
be
represented
by
a
vertical
line
of
varying
thickness
,
ascending
through
the
successive
geological
formations
,
in
which
the
species
are
found
,
the
line
will
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
begin
at
its
lower
end
,
not
in
a
sharp
point
,
but
abruptly
;
it
then
gradually
thickens
upwards
,
often
keeping
of
equal
thickness
for
a
space
,
and
ultimately
thins
out
in
the
upper
beds
,
marking
the
decrease
and
final
extinction
of
the
species
.
This
gradual
increase
in
number
of
the
species
of
a
group
is
strictly
conformable
with
the
theory
,
for
the
species
of
the
same
genus
,
and
the
genera
of
the
same
family
,
can
increase
only
slowly
and
progressively
;
the
process
of
modification
and
the
production
of
a
number
of
allied
forms
necessarily
being
a
slow
and
gradual
process
,
one
species
first
giving
rise
to
two
or
three
varieties
,
these
being
slowly
converted
into
species
,
which
in
their
turn
produce
by
equally
slow
steps
other
varieties
and
species
,
and
so
on
,
like
the
branching
of
a
great
tree
from
a
single
stem
,
till
the
group
becomes
large
.
On
Extinction
We
have
as
yet
only
spoken
incidentally
of
the
disappearance
of
species
and
of
groups
of
species
.
On
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
the
extinction
of
old
forms
and
the
production
of
new
and
improved
forms
are
intimately
connected
together
.
The
old
notion
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
having
been
swept
away
by
catastrophes
at
successive
periods
is
very
generally
given
up
,
even
by
those
geologists
,
as
Elie
de
Beaumont
,
Murchison
,
Barrande
,
&c
.
,
whose
general
views
would
naturally
lead
them
to
this
conclusion
.
On
the
contrary
,
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
,
from
the
study
of
the
tertiary
formations
,
that
species
and
groups
of
species
gradually
disappear
,
one
after
another
,
first
from
one
spot
,
then
from
another
,
and
finally
from
the
world
.
In
some
few
cases
however
,
as
by
the
breaking
of
an
isthmus
and
the
consequent
irruption
of
a
multitude
of
new
inhabitants
into
an
adjoining
sea
,
or
by
the
final
subsidence
of
an
island
,
the
process
of
extinction
may
have
been
rapid
.
Both
single
species
and
whole
groups
of
species
last
for
very
unequal
periods
;
some
groups
,
as
we
have
seen
,
have
endured
from
the
earliest
known
dawn
of
life
to
the
present
day
;
some
have
disappeared
before
the
close
of
the
palaeozoic
period
.
No
fixed
law
seems
to
determine
the
length
of
time
during
which
any
single
species
or
any
single
genus
endures
.
There
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
extinction
of
a
whole
group
of
species
is
generally
a
slower
process
than
their
production
:
if
their
appearance
and
disappearance
be
represented
,
as
before
,
by
a
vertical
line
of
varying
thickness
the
line
is
found
to
taper
more
gradually
at
its
upper
end
,
which
marks
the
progress
of
extermination
,
than
at
its
lower
end
,
which
marks
the
first
appearance
and
the
early
increase
in
number
of
the
species
.
In
some
cases
,
however
,
the
extermination
of
whole
groups
,
as
of
ammonites
,
towards
the
close
of
the
secondary
period
,
has
been
wonderfully
sudden
.
The
extinction
of
species
has
been
involved
in
the
most
gratuitous
mystery
.
Some
authors
have
even
supposed
that
,
as
the
individual
has
a
definite
length
of
life
,
so
have
species
a
definite
duration
.
No
one
can
have
marvelled
more
than
I
have
done
at
the
extinction
of
species
.
When
I
found
in
La
Plata
the
tooth
of
a
horse
embedded
with
the
remains
of
Mastodon
,
Megatherium
,
Toxodon
,
and
other
extinct
monsters
,
which
all
co
existed
with
still
living
shells
at
a
very
late
geological
period
,
I
was
filled
with
astonishment
;
for
,
seeing
that
the
horse
,
since
its
introduction
by
the
Spaniards
into
South
America
,
has
run
wild
over
the
whole
country
and
has
increased
in
numbers
at
an
unparalleled
rate
,
I
asked
myself
what
could
so
recently
have
exterminated
the
former
horse
under
conditions
of
life
apparently
so
favourable
.
But
my
astonishment
was
groundless
.
Professor
Owen
soon
perceived
that
the
tooth
,
though
so
like
that
of
the
existing
horse
,
belonged
to
an
extinct
species
.
Had
this
horse
been
still
living
,
but
in
some
degree
rare
,
no
naturalist
would
have
felt
the
least
surprise
at
its
rarity
;
for
rarity
is
the
attribute
of
a
vast
number
of
species
of
all
classes
,
in
all
countries
.
If
we
ask
ourselves
why
this
or
that
species
is
rare
,
we
answer
that
something
is
unfavourable
in
its
conditions
of
life
;
but
what
that
something
is
we
can
hardly
ever
tell
.
On
the
supposition
of
the
fossil
horse
still
existing
as
a
rare
species
,
we
might
have
felt
certain
,
from
the
analogy
of
all
other
mammals
,
even
of
the
slow
breeding
elephant
,
and
from
the
history
of
the
naturalisation
of
the
domestic
horse
in
South
America
,
that
under
more
favourable
conditions
it
would
in
a
very
few
years
have
stocked
the
whole
continent
.
But
we
could
not
have
told
what
the
unfavourable
conditions
were
which
checked
its
increase
,
whether
some
one
or
several
contingencies
,
and
at
what
period
of
the
horse's
life
,
and
in
what
degree
they
severally
acted
.
If
the
conditions
had
gone
on
,
however
slowly
,
becoming
less
and
less
favourable
,
we
assuredly
should
not
have
perceived
the
fact
,
yet
the
fossil
horse
would
certainly
have
become
rarer
and
rarer
,
and
finally
extinct
;
its
place
being
seized
on
by
some
more
successful
competitor
.
It
is
most
difficult
always
to
remember
that
the
increase
of
every
creature
is
constantly
being
checked
by
unperceived
hostile
agencies
;
and
that
these
same
unperceived
agencies
are
amply
sufficient
to
cause
rarity
,
and
finally
extinction
.
So
little
is
this
subject
understood
,
that
I
have
heard
surprise
repeatedly
expressed
at
such
great
monsters
as
the
Mastodon
and
the
more
ancient
dinosaurians
having
become
extinct
;
as
if
mere
bodily
strength
gave
victory
in
the
battle
of
life
.
Mere
size
,
on
the
contrary
,
would
in
some
cases
determine
,
as
has
been
remarked
by
Owen
,
quicker
extermination
from
the
greater
amount
of
requisite
food
.
Before
man
inhabited
India
or
Africa
,
some
cause
must
have
checked
the
continued
increase
of
the
existing
elephant
.
A
highly
capable
judge
,
Dr
.
Falconer
,
believes
that
it
is
chiefly
insects
which
,
from
incessantly
harassing
and
weakening
the
elephant
in
India
,
check
its
increase
;
and
this
was
Bruce's
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
African
elephant
in
Abyssinia
.
It
is
certain
that
insects
and
bloodsucking
bats
determine
the
existence
of
the
larger
naturalized
quadrupeds
in
several
parts
of
S
.
America
.
We
see
in
many
cases
in
the
more
recent
tertiary
formations
,
that
rarity
precedes
extinction
;
and
we
know
that
this
has
been
the
progress
of
events
with
those
animals
which
have
been
exterminated
,
either
locally
or
wholly
,
through
man's
agency
.
I
may
repeat
what
I
published
in
1845
,
namely
,
that
to
admit
that
species
generally
become
rare
before
they
become
extinct
to
feel
no
surprise
at
the
rarity
of
a
species
,
and
yet
to
marvel
greatly
when
the
species
ceases
to
exist
,
is
much
the
same
as
to
admit
that
sickness
in
the
individual
is
the
forerunner
of
death
to
feel
no
surprise
at
sickness
,
but
,
when
the
sick
man
dies
,
to
wonder
and
to
suspect
that
he
died
by
some
deed
of
violence
.
The
theory
of
natural
selection
is
grounded
on
the
belief
that
each
new
variety
and
ultimately
each
new
species
,
is
produced
and
maintained
by
having
some
advantage
over
those
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
;
and
the
consequent
extinction
of
the
less
favoured
forms
almost
inevitably
follows
.
It
is
the
same
with
our
domestic
productions
;
when
a
new
and
slightly
improved
variety
has
been
raised
,
it
at
first
supplants
the
less
improved
varieties
in
the
same
neighbourhood
;
when
much
improved
it
is
transported
far
and
near
,
like
our
short
horn
cattle
,
and
takes
the
place
of
other
breeds
in
other
countries
.
Thus
the
appearance
of
new
forms
and
the
disappearance
of
old
forms
,
both
those
naturally
and
those
artificially
produced
,
are
bound
together
.
In
flourishing
groups
,
the
number
of
new
specific
forms
which
have
been
produced
within
a
given
time
has
at
some
periods
probably
been
greater
than
the
number
of
the
old
specific
forms
which
have
been
exterminated
;
but
we
know
that
species
have
not
gone
on
indefinitely
increasing
,
at
least
during
the
later
geological
epochs
,
so
that
,
looking
to
later
times
,
we
may
believe
that
the
production
of
new
forms
has
caused
the
extinction
of
about
the
same
number
of
old
forms
.
The
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
,
as
formerly
explained
and
illustrated
by
examples
,
between
the
forms
which
are
most
like
each
other
in
all
respects
.
Hence
the
improved
and
modified
descendants
of
a
species
will
generally
cause
the
extermination
of
the
parent
species
;
and
if
many
new
forms
have
been
developed
from
any
one
species
,
the
nearest
allies
of
that
species
,
i
.
e
.
the
species
of
the
same
genus
,
will
be
the
most
liable
to
extermination
.
Thus
,
as
I
believe
,
a
number
of
new
species
descended
from
one
species
,
that
is
a
new
genus
,
comes
to
supplant
an
old
genus
,
belonging
to
the
same
family
.
But
it
must
often
have
happened
that
a
new
species
belonging
to
some
one
group
has
seized
on
the
place
occupied
by
a
species
belonging
to
a
distinct
group
,
and
thus
have
caused
its
extermination
.
If
many
allied
forms
be
developed
from
the
successful
intruder
,
many
will
have
to
yield
their
places
;
and
it
will
generally
be
the
allied
forms
,
which
will
suffer
from
some
inherited
inferiority
in
common
.
But
whether
it
be
species
belonging
to
the
same
or
to
a
distinct
class
,
which
have
yielded
their
places
to
other
modified
and
improved
species
,
a
few
of
the
sufferers
may
often
be
preserved
for
a
long
time
,
from
being
fitted
to
some
peculiar
line
of
life
,
or
from
inhabiting
some
distant
and
isolated
station
,
where
they
will
have
escaped
severe
competition
.
For
instance
,
some
species
of
Trigonia
,
a
great
genus
of
shells
in
the
secondary
formations
,
survive
in
the
Australian
seas
;
and
a
few
members
of
the
great
and
almost
extinct
group
of
ganoid
fishes
still
inhabit
our
fresh
waters
.
Therefore
the
utter
extinction
of
a
group
is
generally
,
as
we
have
seen
,
a
slower
process
than
its
production
.
With
respect
to
the
apparently
sudden
extermination
of
whole
families
or
orders
,
as
of
trilobites
at
the
close
of
the
palaeozoic
period
and
of
ammonites
at
the
close
of
the
secondary
period
,
we
must
remember
what
has
been
already
said
on
the
probable
wide
intervals
of
time
between
our
consecutive
formations
;
and
in
these
intervals
there
may
have
been
much
slow
extermination
.
Moreover
,
when
,
by
sudden
immigration
or
by
unusually
rapid
development
,
many
species
of
a
new
group
have
taken
possession
of
an
area
,
many
of
the
older
species
will
have
been
exterminated
in
a
correspondingly
rapid
manner
;
and
the
forms
which
thus
yield
their
places
will
commonly
be
allied
,
for
they
will
partake
of
the
same
inferiority
in
common
.
Thus
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
the
manner
in
which
single
species
and
whole
groups
of
species
become
extinct
accords
well
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
.
We
need
not
marvel
at
extinction
;
if
we
must
marvel
,
let
it
be
at
our
own
presumption
in
imagining
for
a
moment
that
we
understand
the
many
complex
contingencies
on
which
the
existence
of
each
species
depends
.
If
we
forget
for
an
instant
that
each
species
tends
to
increase
inordinately
,
and
that
some
check
is
always
in
action
,
yet
seldom
perceived
by
us
,
the
whole
economy
of
nature
will
be
utterly
obscured
.
Whenever
we
can
precisely
say
why
this
species
is
more
abundant
in
individuals
than
that
;
why
this
species
and
not
another
can
be
naturalised
in
a
given
country
;
then
,
and
not
until
then
,
we
may
justly
feel
surprise
why
we
cannot
account
for
the
extinction
of
any
particular
species
or
group
of
species
.
On
the
Forms
of
Life
changing
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
World
Scarcely
any
palaeontological
discovery
is
more
striking
than
the
fact
that
the
forms
of
life
change
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
.
Thus
our
European
Chalk
formation
can
be
recognised
in
many
distant
regions
,
under
the
most
different
climates
,
where
not
a
fragment
of
the
mineral
chalk
itself
can
be
found
;
namely
in
North
America
,
in
equatorial
South
America
,
in
Tierra
del
Fuego
,
at
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
and
in
the
peninsula
of
India
.
For
at
these
distant
points
,
the
organic
remains
in
certain
beds
present
an
unmistakable
resemblance
to
those
of
the
Chalk
.
It
is
not
that
the
same
species
are
met
with
;
for
in
some
cases
not
one
species
is
identically
the
same
,
but
they
belong
to
the
same
families
,
genera
,
and
sections
of
genera
,
and
sometimes
are
similarly
characterised
in
such
trifling
points
as
mere
superficial
sculpture
.
Moreover
,
other
forms
,
which
are
not
found
in
the
Chalk
of
Europe
,
but
which
occur
in
the
formations
either
above
or
below
,
occur
in
the
same
order
at
these
distant
points
of
the
world
.
In
the
several
successive
palaeozoic
formations
of
Russia
,
Western
Europe
,
and
North
America
,
a
similar
parallelism
in
the
forms
of
life
has
been
observed
by
several
authors
;
so
it
is
,
according
to
Lyell
,
with
the
European
and
North
American
tertiary
deposits
.
Even
if
the
few
fossil
species
which
are
common
to
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
were
kept
wholly
out
of
view
,
the
general
parallelism
in
the
successive
forms
of
life
,
in
the
palaeozoic
and
tertiary
stages
,
would
still
be
manifest
,
and
the
several
formations
could
be
easily
correlated
.
These
observations
,
however
,
relate
to
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
world
:
we
have
not
sufficient
data
to
judge
whether
the
productions
of
the
land
and
of
fresh
water
at
distant
points
change
in
the
same
parallel
manner
.
We
may
doubt
whether
they
have
thus
changed
:
if
the
Megatherium
,
Mylodon
,
Macrauchenia
,
and
Toxodon
had
been
brought
to
Europe
from
La
Plata
,
without
any
information
in
regard
to
their
geological
position
,
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
they
had
co
existed
with
seashells
all
still
living
;
but
as
these
anomalous
monsters
co
existed
with
the
mastodon
and
horse
,
it
might
at
least
have
been
inferred
that
they
had
lived
during
one
of
the
later
tertiary
stages
.
When
the
marine
forms
of
life
are
spoken
of
as
having
changed
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
,
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
expression
relates
to
the
same
year
,
or
to
the
same
century
,
or
even
that
it
has
a
very
strict
geological
sense
;
for
if
all
the
marine
animals
now
living
in
Europe
,
and
all
those
that
lived
in
Europe
during
the
pleistocene
period
(
a
very
remote
period
as
measured
by
years
,
including
the
whole
glacial
epoch
)
were
compared
with
those
now
existing
in
South
America
or
in
Australia
,
the
most
skilful
naturalist
would
hardly
be
able
to
say
whether
the
present
or
the
pleistocene
inhabitants
of
Europe
resembled
most
closely
those
of
the
southern
hemisphere
.
So
,
again
,
several
highly
competent
observers
maintain
that
the
existing
productions
of
the
United
States
are
more
closely
related
to
those
which
lived
in
Europe
during
certain
late
tertiary
stages
,
than
to
the
present
inhabitants
of
Europe
;
and
if
this
be
so
,
it
is
evident
that
fossiliferous
beds
now
deposited
on
the
shores
of
North
America
would
hereafter
be
liable
to
be
classed
with
somewhat
older
European
beds
.
Nevertheless
,
looking
to
a
remotely
future
epoch
,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
all
the
more
modern
marine
formations
,
namely
,
the
upper
pliocene
,
the
pleistocene
and
strictly
modern
beds
of
Europe
,
North
and
South
America
,
and
Australia
,
from
containing
fossil
remains
in
some
degree
allied
,
and
from
not
including
those
forms
which
are
found
only
in
the
older
underlying
deposits
,
would
be
correctly
ranked
as
simultaneous
in
a
geological
sense
.
The
fact
of
the
forms
of
life
changing
simultaneously
,
in
the
above
large
sense
,
at
distant
parts
of
the
world
,
has
greatly
struck
these
admirable
observers
,
MM
.
de
Verneuil
and
d'Archiae
.
After
referring
to
the
parallelism
of
the
palaeozoic
forms
of
life
in
various
parts
of
Europe
,
they
add
,
"
If
,
struck
by
this
strange
sequence
,
we
turn
our
attention
to
North
America
,
and
there
discover
a
series
of
analogous
phenomena
,
it
will
appear
certain
that
all
these
modifications
of
species
,
their
extinction
,
and
the
introduction
of
new
ones
,
cannot
be
owing
to
mere
changes
in
marine
currents
or
other
causes
more
or
less
local
and
temporary
,
but
depend
on
general
laws
which
govern
the
whole
animal
kingdom
.
"
M
.
Barrande
has
made
forcible
remarks
to
precisely
the
same
effect
.
It
is
,
indeed
,
quite
futile
to
look
to
changes
of
currents
,
climate
,
or
other
physical
conditions
,
as
the
cause
of
these
great
mutations
in
the
forms
of
life
throughout
the
world
,
under
the
most
different
climates
.
We
must
,
as
Barrande
has
remarked
,
look
to
some
special
law
.
We
shall
see
this
more
clearly
when
we
treat
of
the
present
distribution
of
organic
beings
,
and
find
how
slight
is
the
relation
between
the
physical
conditions
of
various
countries
and
the
nature
of
their
inhabitants
.
This
great
fact
of
the
parallel
succession
of
the
forms
of
life
throughout
the
world
,
is
explicable
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
.
New
species
are
formed
by
having
some
advantage
over
older
forms
;
and
the
forms
,
which
are
already
dominant
,
or
have
some
advantage
over
the
other
forms
in
their
own
country
,
give
birth
to
the
greatest
number
of
new
varieties
or
incipient
species
.
We
have
distinct
evidence
on
this
head
,
in
the
plants
which
are
dominant
,
that
is
,
which
are
commonest
and
most
widely
diffused
,
producing
the
greatest
number
of
new
varieties
.
It
is
also
natural
that
the
dominant
,
varying
,
and
far
spreading
species
,
which
have
already
invaded
to
a
certain
extent
the
territories
of
other
species
,
should
be
those
which
would
have
the
best
chance
of
spreading
still
further
,
and
of
giving
rise
in
new
countries
to
other
new
varieties
and
species
.
The
process
of
diffusion
would
often
be
very
slow
,
depending
on
climatal
and
geographical
changes
,
on
strange
accidents
,
and
on
the
gradual
acclimatisation
of
new
species
to
the
various
climates
through
which
they
might
have
to
pass
,
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
dominant
forms
would
generally
succeed
in
spreading
and
would
ultimately
prevail
.
The
diffusion
would
,
it
is
probable
,
be
slower
with
the
terrestrial
inhabitants
of
distinct
continents
than
with
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
continuous
sea
.
We
might
therefore
expect
to
find
,
as
we
do
find
,
a
less
strict
degree
of
parallelism
in
the
succession
of
the
productions
of
the
land
than
with
those
of
the
sea
.
Thus
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
the
parallel
,
and
,
taken
in
a
large
sense
,
simultaneous
,
succession
of
the
same
forms
of
life
throughout
the
world
,
accords
well
with
the
principle
of
new
species
having
been
formed
by
dominant
species
spreading
widely
and
varying
;
the
new
species
thus
produced
being
themselves
dominant
,
owing
to
their
having
had
some
advantage
over
their
already
dominant
parents
,
as
well
as
over
other
species
,
and
again
spreading
,
varying
,
and
producing
new
forms
.
The
old
forms
which
are
beaten
and
which
yield
their
places
to
the
new
and
victorious
forms
,
will
generally
be
allied
in
groups
,
from
inheriting
some
inferiority
in
common
;
and
therefore
,
as
new
and
improved
groups
spread
throughout
the
world
,
old
groups
disappear
from
the
world
;
and
the
succession
of
forms
everywhere
tends
to
correspond
both
in
their
first
appearance
and
final
disappearance
.
There
is
one
other
remark
connected
with
this
subject
worth
making
.
I
have
given
my
reasons
for
believing
that
most
of
our
great
formations
,
rich
in
fossils
,
were
deposited
during
periods
of
subsidence
;
and
that
blank
intervals
of
vast
duration
,
as
far
as
fossils
are
concerned
,
occurred
during
the
periods
when
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
either
stationary
or
rising
,
and
likewise
when
sediment
was
not
thrown
down
quickly
enough
to
embed
and
preserve
organic
remains
.
During
these
long
and
blank
intervals
I
suppose
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
region
underwent
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
and
extinction
,
and
that
there
was
much
migration
from
other
parts
of
the
world
.
As
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
large
areas
are
affected
by
the
same
movement
,
it
is
probable
that
strictly
contemporaneous
formations
have
often
been
accumulated
over
very
wide
spaces
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
world
;
but
we
are
very
far
from
having
any
right
to
conclude
that
this
has
invariably
been
the
case
,
and
that
large
areas
have
invariably
been
affected
by
the
same
movements
.
When
two
formations
have
been
deposited
in
two
regions
during
nearly
,
but
not
exactly
,
the
same
period
,
we
should
find
in
both
,
from
the
causes
explained
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs
,
the
same
general
succession
in
the
forms
of
life
;
but
the
species
would
not
exactly
correspond
;
for
there
will
have
been
a
little
more
time
in
the
one
region
than
in
the
other
for
modification
,
extinction
,
and
immigration
.
I
suspect
that
cases
of
this
nature
occur
in
Europe
.
Mr
.
Prestwich
,
in
his
admirable
Memoirs
on
the
eocene
deposits
of
England
and
France
,
is
able
to
draw
a
close
general
parallelism
between
the
successive
stages
in
the
two
countries
;
but
when
he
compares
certain
stages
in
England
with
those
in
France
,
although
he
finds
in
both
a
curious
accordance
in
the
numbers
of
the
species
belonging
to
the
same
genera
,
yet
the
species
themselves
differ
in
a
very
,
difficult
to
account
for
,
considering
the
proximity
of
the
two
areas
,
unless
,
indeed
,
it
be
assumed
that
an
isthmus
separated
two
seas
inhabited
by
distinct
,
but
contemporaneous
,
faunas
.
Lyell
has
made
similar
observations
on
some
of
the
later
tertiary
formations
.
Barrande
,
also
,
shows
that
there
is
a
striking
general
parallelism
in
the
successive
Silurian
deposits
of
Bohemia
and
Scandinavia
;
nevertheless
he
finds
a
surprising
amount
of
difference
in
the
species
.
If
the
several
formations
in
these
regions
have
not
been
deposited
during
the
same
exact
periods
,
a
formation
in
one
region
often
corresponding
with
a
blank
interval
in
the
other
,
and
if
in
both
regions
the
species
have
gone
on
slowly
changing
during
the
accumulation
of
the
several
formations
and
during
the
long
intervals
of
time
between
them
;
in
this
case
the
several
formations
in
the
two
regions
could
be
arranged
in
the
same
order
,
in
accordance
with
the
general
succession
of
the
forms
of
life
,
and
the
order
would
falsely
appear
to
be
strictly
parallel
;
nevertheless
the
species
would
not
be
all
the
same
in
the
apparently
corresponding
stages
in
the
two
regions
.
On
the
Affinities
of
Extinct
Species
to
each
other
,
and
to
Living
Forms
Let
us
now
look
to
the
mutual
affinities
of
extinct
and
living
species
.
All
fall
into
a
few
grand
classes
;
and
this
fact
is
once
explained
on
the
principle
of
descent
.
The
more
ancient
any
form
is
,
the
more
,
as
a
general
rule
,
it
differs
from
living
forms
.
But
,
as
Buckland
long
ago
remarked
,
extinct
species
can
all
be
classed
either
in
still
existing
groups
,
or
between
them
.
That
the
extinct
forms
of
life
help
to
fill
up
the
intervals
between
existing
genera
,
families
,
and
orders
,
is
certainly
true
;
but
as
this
statement
has
often
been
ignored
or
even
denied
,
it
may
be
well
to
make
some
remarks
on
this
subject
,
and
to
give
some
instances
.
If
we
confine
our
attention
either
to
the
living
or
to
the
extinct
species
of
the
same
class
,
the
series
is
far
less
perfect
than
if
we
combine
both
into
one
general
system
.
In
the
writings
of
Professor
Owen
we
continually
meet
with
the
expression
of
generalised
forms
,
as
applied
to
extinct
animals
;
and
in
the
writings
of
Agassiz
,
of
prophetic
or
synthetic
types
;
and
these
terms
imply
that
such
forms
are
in
fact
intermediate
or
connecting
links
.
Another
distinguished
palaeontologist
,
M
.
Gaudry
,
has
shown
in
the
most
striking
manner
that
many
of
the
fossil
mammals
discovered
by
him
in
Attica
serve
to
break
down
the
intervals
between
existing
genera
.
Cuvier
ranked
the
ruminants
and
pachyderms
as
two
of
the
most
distinct
orders
of
mammals
:
but
so
many
fossil
links
have
been
disentombed
that
Owen
has
had
to
alter
the
whole
classification
,
and
has
placed
certain
pachyderms
in
the
same
sub
order
with
ruminants
;
for
example
,
he
dissolves
by
gradations
the
apparently
wide
interval
between
the
pig
and
the
camel
.
The
Ungulata
or
hoofed
quadrupeds
are
now
divided
into
the
even
toed
or
odd
toed
divisions
;
but
the
Maerauchenia
of
S
.
America
connects
to
a
certain
extent
these
two
grand
divisions
.
No
one
will
deny
that
the
Hipparion
is
intermediate
between
the
existing
horse
and
certain
older
ungulate
forms
.
What
a
wonderful
connecting
link
in
the
chain
of
mammals
is
the
Typotherium
from
S
.
America
,
as
the
name
given
to
it
by
Professor
Gervais
expresses
,
and
which
cannot
be
placed
in
any
existing
order
.
The
Sirenia
form
a
very
distinct
group
of
mammals
,
and
one
of
the
most
remarkable
peculiarities
in
the
existing
dugong
and
lamentin
is
the
entire
absence
of
hind
limbs
without
even
a
rudiment
being
left
;
but
the
extinct
Halitherium
had
,
according
to
Professor
Flower
,
an
ossified
thighbone
"
articulated
to
a
well
defined
acetabulum
in
the
pelvis
,
"
and
it
thus
makes
some
approach
to
ordinary
hoofed
quadrupeds
,
to
which
the
Sirenia
are
in
other
respects
allied
.
The
cetaceans
or
whales
are
widely
different
from
all
other
mammals
but
the
tertiary
Zeuglodon
and
Squalodon
,
which
have
been
placed
by
some
naturalists
in
an
order
by
themselves
,
are
considered
by
Professor
Huxley
to
be
undoubtedly
cetaceans
,
"
and
to
constitute
connecting
links
with
the
aquatic
carnivora
.
"
Even
the
wide
interval
between
birds
and
reptiles
has
been
shown
by
the
naturalist
just
quoted
to
be
partially
bridged
over
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
,
on
the
one
hand
,
by
the
ostrich
and
extinct
Archeopteryx
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
by
the
Compsognathus
,
one
of
the
dinosaurians
that
group
which
includes
the
most
gigantic
of
all
terrestrial
reptiles
.
Turning
to
the
Invertebrata
,
Barrande
asserts
,
a
higher
authority
could
not
be
named
,
that
he
is
every
day
taught
that
,
although
palaeozoic
can
certainly
be
classed
under
existing
groups
,
yet
that
at
this
ancient
period
the
groups
were
not
so
distinctly
separated
from
each
other
as
they
now
are
.
Some
writers
have
objected
to
any
extinct
species
,
or
group
of
species
,
being
considered
as
intermediate
between
any
two
living
species
,
or
groups
of
species
.
If
by
this
term
it
is
meant
that
an
extinct
form
is
directly
intermediate
in
all
its
characters
between
two
living
forms
or
groups
,
the
objection
is
probably
valid
.
But
in
a
natural
classification
many
fossil
species
certainly
stand
between
living
species
,
and
some
extinct
genera
between
living
genera
,
even
between
genera
belonging
to
distinct
families
.
The
most
common
case
,
especially
with
respect
to
very
distinct
groups
,
such
as
fish
and
reptiles
,
seems
to
be
,
that
,
supposing
them
to
be
distinguished
at
the
present
day
by
a
score
of
characters
,
the
ancient
members
are
separated
by
a
somewhat
lesser
number
of
characters
;
so
that
the
two
groups
formerly
made
a
somewhat
nearer
approach
to
each
other
than
they
now
do
.
It
is
a
common
belief
that
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
,
by
so
much
the
more
it
tends
to
connect
by
some
of
its
characters
groups
now
widely
separated
from
each
other
.
This
remark
no
doubt
must
be
restricted
to
those
groups
which
have
undergone
much
change
in
the
course
of
geological
ages
;
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proposition
,
for
every
now
and
then
even
a
living
animal
,
as
the
Lepidosiren
,
is
discovered
having
affinities
directed
towards
very
distinct
groups
.
Yet
if
we
compare
the
older
reptiles
and
batrachians
,
the
older
fish
,
the
older
cephalopods
,
and
the
eocene
mammals
,
with
the
more
recent
members
of
the
same
classes
,
we
must
admit
that
there
is
truth
in
the
remark
.
Let
us
see
how
far
these
several
facts
and
inferences
accord
with
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
.
As
the
subject
is
somewhat
complex
,
I
must
request
the
reader
to
turn
to
the
diagram
in
the
fourth
chapter
.
We
may
suppose
that
the
numbered
letters
in
italics
represent
genera
,
and
the
lines
diverging
from
them
the
species
in
each
genus
.
The
diagram
is
much
too
simple
,
too
few
genera
and
too
few
species
being
given
,
but
this
is
unimportant
for
us
.
The
horizontal
lines
may
represent
successive
geological
formations
,
and
all
the
forms
beneath
the
uppermost
line
may
be
considered
as
extinct
.
The
three
existing
genera
a14
,
q14
,
p14
,
will
form
a
small
family
;
b14
,
and
f14
a
closely
allied
family
or
sub
family
;
and
o14
,
e14
,
m14
,
a
third
family
.
These
three
families
,
together
with
the
many
extinct
genera
on
the
several
lines
of
descent
diverging
from
the
parent
form
(
A
)
will
form
an
order
,
for
all
will
have
inherited
something
in
common
from
their
ancient
progenitor
.
On
the
principle
of
the
continued
tendency
to
divergence
of
character
,
which
was
formerly
illustrated
by
this
diagram
,
the
more
recent
any
form
is
,
the
more
it
will
generally
differ
from
its
ancient
progenitor
.
Hence
we
can
understand
the
rule
that
the
most
ancient
fossils
differ
most
from
existing
forms
.
We
must
not
,
however
,
assume
that
divergence
of
character
is
a
necessary
contingency
;
it
depends
solely
on
the
descendants
from
a
species
being
thus
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
different
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
.
Therefore
it
is
quite
possible
,
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
some
Silurian
forms
,
that
a
species
might
go
on
being
slightly
modified
in
relation
to
its
slightly
altered
conditions
of
life
,
and
yet
retain
throughout
a
vast
period
the
same
general
characteristics
.
This
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
letter
F14
.
All
the
many
forms
,
extinct
and
recent
,
descended
from
(
A
)
,
make
,
as
before
remarked
,
one
order
;
and
this
order
,
from
the
continued
effects
of
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
,
has
become
divided
into
several
sub
families
and
families
,
some
of
which
are
supposed
to
have
perished
at
different
periods
,
and
some
to
have
endured
to
the
present
day
.
By
looking
at
the
diagram
we
can
see
that
if
many
of
the
extinct
forms
supposed
to
be
imbedded
in
the
successive
formations
,
were
discovered
at
several
points
low
down
in
the
series
,
the
three
existing
families
on
the
uppermost
line
would
be
rendered
less
distinct
from
each
other
.
If
,
for
instance
,
the
genera
a1
,
a5
,
a10
,
f8
,
m3
,
m6
,
m9
,
were
disinterred
,
these
three
families
would
be
so
closely
linked
together
that
they
probably
would
have
to
be
united
into
one
great
family
,
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
has
occurred
with
ruminants
and
certain
pachyderms
.
Yet
he
who
objected
to
consider
as
intermediate
the
extinct
genera
,
which
thus
link
together
the
living
genera
of
three
families
,
would
be
partly
justified
,
for
they
are
intermediate
,
not
directly
,
but
only
by
a
long
and
circuitous
course
through
many
widely
different
forms
.
If
many
extinct
forms
were
to
be
discovered
above
one
of
the
middle
horizontal
lines
or
geological
formations
for
instance
,
above
No
.
VI
.
but
none
from
beneath
this
line
,
then
only
two
of
the
families
(
those
on
the
left
hand
,
a14
,
&c
.
,
and
b14
,
&c
.
)
would
have
to
be
united
into
one
;
and
there
would
remain
two
families
,
which
would
be
less
distinct
from
each
other
than
they
were
before
the
discovery
of
the
fossils
.
So
again
if
the
three
families
formed
of
eight
genera
(
a14
to
m14
)
,
on
the
uppermost
line
,
be
supposed
to
differ
from
each
other
by
half
a
dozen
important
characters
,
then
the
families
which
existed
at
the
period
marked
VI
.
would
certainly
have
differed
from
each
other
by
a
less
number
of
characters
;
for
they
would
at
this
early
stage
of
descent
have
diverged
in
a
less
degree
from
their
common
progeneitor
.
Thus
it
comes
that
ancient
and
extinct
genera
are
often
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
their
modified
descendants
,
or
between
their
collateral
relations
.
Under
nature
the
process
will
be
far
more
complicated
than
represented
in
the
diagram
;
for
the
groups
will
have
been
more
numerous
;
they
will
have
endured
for
extremely
unequal
lengths
of
time
,
and
will
have
been
modified
in
various
degrees
.
As
we
possess
only
the
last
volume
of
the
geological
record
,
and
that
in
a
very
broken
condition
,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
,
except
in
rare
cases
,
to
fill
up
the
wide
intervals
in
the
natural
system
,
and
thus
to
unite
distinct
families
or
orders
.
All
that
we
have
a
right
to
expect
is
,
that
those
groups
which
have
,
within
known
geological
periods
,
undergone
much
modification
,
should
in
the
older
formations
make
some
slight
approach
to
each
other
;
so
that
the
older
members
should
differ
less
from
each
other
in
some
of
their
characters
than
do
the
existing
members
of
the
same
groups
;
and
this
by
the
concurrent
evidence
of
our
best
palaeontologists
is
frequently
the
case
.
Thus
,
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
,
the
main
facts
with
respect
to
the
mutual
affinities
of
the
extinct
forms
of
life
to
each
other
and
to
living
forms
,
are
explained
in
a
satisfactory
manner
.
And
they
are
wholly
inexplicable
on
any
other
view
.
On
this
same
theory
,
it
is
evident
that
the
fauna
during
any
one
great
period
in
the
earth's
history
will
be
intermediate
in
general
character
between
that
which
preceded
and
that
which
succeeded
it
.
Thus
the
species
which
lived
at
the
sixth
great
stage
of
descent
in
the
diagram
are
the
modified
offspring
of
those
which
lived
at
the
sixth
stage
of
descent
,
and
are
the
parents
of
those
which
became
still
more
modified
at
the
seventh
stage
;
hence
they
could
hardly
fail
to
be
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
the
forms
of
life
above
and
below
.
We
must
,
however
,
allow
for
the
entire
extinction
of
some
preceding
forms
,
and
in
any
one
region
for
the
immigration
of
new
forms
from
other
regions
,
and
for
a
large
amount
of
modification
during
the
long
and
blank
intervals
between
the
successive
formations
.
Subject
to
these
allowances
,
the
fauna
of
each
geological
period
undoubtedly
is
intermediate
in
character
,
between
the
preceding
and
succeeding
faunas
.
I
need
give
only
one
instance
,
namely
,
the
manner
in
which
the
fossils
of
the
Devonian
system
,
when
this
system
was
first
discovered
,
were
at
once
recognized
by
palaeontologists
as
intermediate
in
character
between
those
of
the
overlying
carboniferous
,
and
underlying
Silurian
systems
.
But
each
fauna
is
not
necessarily
exactly
intermediate
,
as
unequal
intervals
of
time
have
elapsed
between
consecutive
formations
.
It
is
no
real
objection
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
the
fauna
of
each
period
as
a
whole
is
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
preceding
and
succeeding
faunas
,
that
certain
genera
offer
exceptions
to
the
rule
.
For
instance
,
the
species
of
mastodons
and
elephants
,
when
arranged
by
Dr
.
Falconer
in
two
series
,
the
first
place
according
to
their
mutual
affinities
,
and
in
the
second
place
according
to
their
periods
of
existence
,
do
not
accord
in
arrangement
.
The
species
extreme
in
character
are
not
the
oldest
or
the
most
recent
;
nor
are
those
which
are
intermediate
in
character
,
intermediate
in
age
.
But
supposing
for
an
instant
,
in
this
and
other
such
cases
,
that
the
record
of
the
first
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
species
was
complete
,
which
is
far
from
the
case
,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
forms
successively
produced
necessarily
endure
for
corresponding
lengths
of
time
.
A
very
ancient
form
may
occasionally
have
lasted
much
longer
than
a
form
elsewhere
subsequently
produced
,
especially
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
productions
inhabiting
separated
districts
.
To
compare
small
things
with
great
;
if
the
principal
living
and
extinct
races
of
the
domestic
pigeon
were
arranged
in
serial
affinity
,
this
arrangement
would
not
closely
accord
with
the
order
in
time
of
their
production
,
and
even
less
with
the
order
of
their
disappearance
;
for
the
parent
rock
pigeon
still
lives
;
and
many
varieties
between
the
rock
pigeon
and
the
carrier
have
become
extinct
;
and
carriers
which
are
extreme
in
the
important
character
of
length
of
beak
originated
earlier
than
short
beaked
tumblers
,
which
are
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
series
in
this
respect
.
Closely
connected
with
the
statement
,
that
the
organic
remains
from
an
intermediate
formation
are
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
,
is
the
fact
,
insisted
on
by
all
palaeontologists
,
that
fossils
from
two
consecutive
formations
are
far
more
closely
related
to
each
other
,
than
are
the
fossils
from
two
remote
formations
.
Pictet
gives
as
a
well
known
instance
,
the
general
resemblance
of
the
organic
remains
from
the
several
stages
of
the
Chalk
formation
,
though
the
species
are
distinct
in
each
stage
.
This
fact
alone
,
from
its
generality
,
seems
to
have
shaken
Professor
Pictet
in
his
belief
in
the
immutability
of
species
.
He
who
is
acquainted
with
the
distribution
of
existing
species
over
the
globe
,
will
not
attempt
to
account
for
the
close
resemblance
of
distinct
species
in
closely
consecutive
formations
,
by
the
physical
conditions
of
the
ancient
areas
having
remained
nearly
the
same
.
Let
it
be
remembered
that
the
forms
of
life
,
at
least
those
inhabiting
the
sea
,
have
changed
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
,
and
therefore
under
the
most
different
climates
and
conditions
.
Consider
the
prodigious
vicissitudes
of
climate
during
the
pleistocene
period
,
which
includes
the
whole
glacial
epoch
,
and
note
how
little
the
specific
forms
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
have
been
affected
.
On
the
theory
of
descent
,
the
full
meaning
of
the
fossil
remains
from
closely
consecutive
formations
being
closely
related
,
though
ranked
as
distinct
species
,
is
obvious
.
As
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
has
often
been
interrupted
,
and
as
long
blank
intervals
have
intervened
between
successive
formations
,
we
ought
not
to
expect
to
find
,
as
I
attempted
to
show
in
the
last
chapter
,
in
any
one
or
in
any
two
formations
,
all
the
intermediate
varieties
between
the
species
which
appeared
at
the
commencement
and
close
of
these
periods
:
but
we
ought
to
find
after
intervals
,
very
long
as
measured
by
years
,
but
only
moderately
long
as
measured
geologically
,
closely
allied
forms
,
or
,
as
they
have
been
called
by
some
authors
,
representative
species
;
and
these
assuredly
we
do
find
.
We
find
,
in
short
,
such
evidence
of
the
slow
and
scarcely
sensible
mutations
of
specific
forms
,
as
we
have
the
right
to
expect
.
On
the
State
of
Development
of
Ancient
compared
with
Living
Forms
We
have
seen
in
the
fourth
chapter
that
the
degree
of
differentiation
and
specialisation
of
the
parts
in
organic
beings
,
when
arrived
at
maturity
,
is
the
best
standard
,
as
yet
suggested
,
of
their
degree
of
perfection
or
highness
.
We
have
also
seen
that
,
as
the
specialisation
of
parts
is
an
advantage
to
each
being
,
so
natural
selection
will
tend
to
render
the
organisation
of
each
being
more
specialised
and
perfect
,
and
in
this
sense
higher
;
not
but
that
it
may
leave
many
creatures
with
simple
and
unimproved
structures
fitted
for
simple
conditions
of
life
,
and
in
some
cases
will
even
degrade
or
simplify
the
organisation
,
yet
leaving
such
degraded
beings
better
fitted
for
their
new
walks
of
life
.
In
another
and
more
general
manner
,
new
species
become
superior
to
their
predecessors
;
for
they
have
to
beat
in
the
struggle
for
life
all
the
older
forms
,
with
which
they
come
into
close
competition
.
We
may
therefore
conclude
that
if
under
a
nearly
similar
climate
the
eocene
inhabitants
of
the
world
could
be
put
into
competition
with
the
existing
inhabitants
,
the
former
would
be
beaten
and
exterminated
by
the
latter
,
as
would
the
secondary
by
the
eocene
,
and
the
palaeozoic
by
the
secondary
forms
.
So
that
by
this
fundamental
test
of
victory
in
the
battle
for
life
,
as
well
as
by
the
standard
of
the
specialisation
of
organs
,
modern
forms
ought
,
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
to
stand
higher
than
ancient
forms
.
Is
this
the
case
?
A
large
majority
of
palaeontologists
would
answer
in
the
affirmative
;
and
it
seems
that
this
answer
must
be
admitted
as
true
,
though
difficult
of
proof
.
It
is
no
valid
objection
to
this
conclusion
,
that
certain
brachiopods
have
been
but
slightly
modified
from
an
extremely
remote
geological
epoch
;
and
that
certain
land
and
fresh
water
shells
have
remained
nearly
the
same
,
from
the
time
when
,
as
far
as
is
known
,
they
first
appeared
.
It
is
not
an
insuperable
difficulty
that
Foraminifera
have
not
,
as
insisted
on
by
Dr
.
Carpenter
,
progressed
in
organisation
since
even
the
Laurentian
epoch
;
for
some
organisms
would
have
to
remain
fitted
for
simple
conditions
of
life
,
and
what
could
be
better
fitted
for
this
end
than
these
lowly
organised
Protozoa
?
Such
objections
as
the
above
would
be
fatal
to
my
view
,
if
it
included
advance
in
organisation
as
a
necessary
contingent
.
They
would
likewise
be
fatal
,
if
the
above
Foraminifera
,
for
instance
,
could
be
proved
to
have
first
come
into
existence
during
the
Laurentian
epoch
,
or
the
above
brachiopods
during
the
Cambrian
formation
;
for
in
this
case
,
there
would
not
have
been
time
sufficient
for
the
development
of
these
organisms
up
to
the
standard
which
they
had
then
reached
.
When
advanced
up
to
any
given
point
,
there
is
no
necessity
,
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
for
their
further
continued
progress
;
though
they
will
,
during
each
successive
age
,
have
to
be
slightly
modified
,
so
as
to
hold
their
places
in
relation
to
slight
changes
in
their
conditions
.
The
foregoing
objections
hinge
on
the
question
whether
we
really
know
how
old
the
world
is
,
and
at
what
period
the
various
forms
of
life
first
appeared
;
and
this
may
well
be
disputed
.
The
problem
whether
organisation
on
the
whole
has
advanced
is
in
many
ways
excessively
intricate
.
The
geological
record
,
at
all
times
imperfect
,
does
not
extend
far
enough
back
to
show
with
unmistakable
clearness
that
within
the
known
history
of
the
world
organisation
has
largely
advanced
.
Even
at
the
present
day
,
looking
to
members
of
the
same
class
,
naturalists
are
not
unanimous
which
forms
ought
to
be
ranked
as
highest
:
thus
,
some
look
at
the
selaceans
or
sharks
,
from
their
approach
in
some
important
points
of
structure
to
reptiles
,
as
the
highest
fish
;
others
look
at
the
teleosteans
as
the
highest
.
The
ganoids
stand
intermediate
between
the
selaceans
and
teleosteans
;
the
latter
at
the
present
day
are
largely
preponderant
in
number
;
but
formerly
selaceans
and
ganoids
alone
existed
;
and
in
this
case
,
according
to
the
standard
of
highness
chosen
,
so
will
it
be
said
that
fishes
have
advanced
or
retrograded
in
organisation
.
To
attempt
to
compare
members
of
distinct
types
in
the
scale
of
highness
seem
hopeless
;
who
will
decide
whether
a
cuttle
fish
be
higher
than
a
bee
that
insect
which
the
great
von
Baer
believed
to
be
"
in
fact
more
highly
organised
than
a
fish
,
although
upon
another
type
"
?
In
the
complex
struggle
for
life
it
is
quite
credible
that
crustaceans
,
not
very
high
in
their
own
class
,
might
beat
cephalopods
,
the
highest
molluscs
;
and
such
crustaceans
,
though
not
highly
developed
,
would
stand
very
high
in
the
scale
of
invertebrate
animals
,
if
judged
by
the
most
decisive
of
all
trials
the
law
of
battle
.
Besides
these
inherent
difficulties
in
deciding
which
forms
are
the
most
advanced
in
organisation
,
we
ought
not
solely
to
compare
the
highest
members
of
a
class
at
any
two
periods
though
undoubtedly
this
is
one
and
perhaps
the
most
important
element
in
striking
a
balance
but
we
ought
to
compare
all
the
members
,
high
and
low
,
at
the
two
periods
.
At
an
ancient
epoch
the
highest
and
lowest
molluscoidal
animals
,
namely
,
cephalopods
and
brachiopods
,
swarmed
in
numbers
;
at
the
present
time
both
groups
are
greatly
reduced
,
whilst
others
,
intermediate
in
organisation
,
have
largely
increased
;
consequently
some
naturalists
maintain
that
molluscs
were
formerly
more
highly
developed
than
at
present
;
but
a
stronger
case
can
be
made
out
on
the
opposite
side
,
by
considering
the
vast
reduction
of
brachiopods
,
and
the
fact
that
our
existing
cephalopods
,
though
few
in
number
,
are
more
highly
organised
than
their
ancient
representatives
.
We
ought
also
to
compare
the
relative
proportional
numbers
at
any
two
periods
of
the
high
and
low
classes
throughout
the
world
:
if
,
for
instance
,
at
the
present
day
fifty
thousand
kinds
of
vertebrate
animals
exist
,
and
if
we
knew
that
at
some
former
period
only
ten
thousand
kinds
existed
,
we
ought
to
look
at
this
increase
in
number
in
the
highest
class
,
which
implies
a
great
displacement
of
lower
forms
,
as
a
decided
advance
in
the
organisation
of
the
world
.
We
thus
see
how
hopelessly
difficult
it
is
to
compare
with
perfect
fairness
such
extremely
complex
relations
,
the
standards
of
organisation
of
the
imperfectly
known
faunas
of
successive
periods
.
We
shall
appreciate
this
difficulty
more
clearly
,
by
looking
to
certain
existing
faunas
and
floras
.
From
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
European
productions
have
recently
spread
over
New
Zealand
,
and
have
seized
on
places
which
must
have
been
previously
occupied
by
the
indigenes
,
we
must
believe
,
that
if
all
the
animals
and
plants
of
Great
Britain
were
set
free
in
New
Zealand
,
a
multitude
of
British
forms
would
in
the
course
of
time
become
thoroughly
naturalised
there
,
and
would
exterminate
many
of
the
natives
.
On
the
other
hand
,
from
the
fact
that
hardly
a
single
inhabitant
of
the
southern
hemisphere
has
become
wild
in
any
part
of
Europe
,
we
may
well
doubt
whether
,
if
all
the
productions
of
New
Zealand
were
set
free
in
Great
Britain
,
any
considerable
number
would
be
enabled
to
seize
on
places
now
occupied
by
our
native
plants
and
animals
.
Under
this
point
of
view
,
the
productions
of
Great
Britain
stand
much
higher
in
the
scale
than
those
of
New
Zealand
.
Yet
the
most
skilful
naturalist
,
from
an
examination
Of
the
species
of
the
species
of
the
two
countries
,
could
not
have
foreseen
this
result
.
Agassiz
and
several
other
highly
competent
judges
insist
that
ancient
animals
resemble
to
a
certain
extent
the
embryos
of
recent
animals
belonging
to
the
same
classes
;
and
that
the
geological
succession
of
extinct
forms
is
nearly
parallel
with
the
embryological
development
of
existing
forms
.
This
view
accords
admirably
well
with
our
theory
.
In
a
future
chapter
I
shall
attempt
to
show
that
the
adult
differs
from
its
embryo
,
owing
to
variations
having
supervened
at
a
not
early
age
,
and
having
been
inherited
at
a
corresponding
age
.
This
process
,
whilst
it
leaves
the
embryo
almost
unaltered
,
continually
adds
,
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
,
more
and
more
difference
to
the
adult
.
Thus
the
embryo
comes
to
be
left
as
a
sort
of
picture
,
preserved
by
nature
,
of
the
former
and
less
modified
condition
of
the
species
.
This
view
may
be
true
,
and
yet
may
never
be
capable
of
proof
.
Seeing
,
for
instance
,
that
the
oldest
known
mammals
,
reptiles
,
and
fishes
strictly
belong
to
their
proper
classes
,
though
some
of
these
old
forms
are
in
a
slight
degree
less
distinct
from
each
other
than
are
the
typical
members
of
the
same
groups
at
the
present
day
,
it
would
be
vain
to
look
for
animals
having
the
common
embryological
character
of
the
Vertebrata
,
until
beds
rich
in
fossils
are
discovered
far
beneath
the
lowest
Cambrian
strata
a
discovery
of
which
the
chance
is
small
.
On
the
Succession
of
the
same
Types
within
the
same
Areas
,
during
the
later
Tertiary
periods
Mr
.
Clift
many
years
ago
showed
that
the
fossil
mammals
from
the
Australian
caves
were
closely
allied
to
the
living
marsupials
of
that
continent
.
In
South
America
a
similar
relationship
is
manifest
,
even
to
an
uneducated
eye
,
in
the
gigantic
pieces
of
armour
,
like
those
of
the
armadillo
,
found
in
several
parts
of
La
Plata
;
and
Professor
Owen
has
shown
in
the
most
striking
manner
that
most
of
the
fossil
mammals
,
buried
there
in
such
numbers
,
are
related
to
South
American
types
.
This
relationship
is
even
more
clearly
seen
in
the
wonderful
collection
of
fossil
bones
made
by
MM
.
Lund
and
Clausen
in
the
caves
of
Brazil
.
I
was
so
much
impressed
with
these
facts
that
I
strongly
insisted
,
in
1839
and
1845
,
on
this
"
law
of
the
succession
of
types
,
"
on
"
this
wonderful
relationship
in
the
same
continent
between
the
dead
and
the
living
.
"
Professor
Owen
has
subsequently
extended
the
same
generalisation
to
the
mammals
of
the
Old
World
.
We
see
the
same
law
in
this
author's
restorations
of
the
extinct
and
gigantic
birds
of
New
Zealand
.
We
see
it
also
in
the
birds
of
the
caves
of
Brazil
.
Mr
.
Woodward
has
shown
that
the
same
law
holds
good
with
sea
shells
,
but
,
from
the
wide
distribution
of
most
molluscs
,
it
is
not
well
displayed
by
them
.
Other
cases
could
be
added
,
as
the
relation
between
the
extinct
and
living
land
shells
of
Madeira
;
and
between
the
extinct
and
living
brackish
watershells
of
the
Aralo
Caspian
Sea
.
Now
what
does
this
remarkable
law
of
the
succession
of
the
same
types
within
the
same
areas
mean
?
He
would
be
a
bold
man
who
,
after
comparing
the
present
climate
of
Australia
and
of
parts
of
South
America
,
under
the
same
latitude
,
would
attempt
to
account
,
on
the
one
hand
through
dissimilar
physical
conditions
,
for
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
these
two
continents
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
through
similarity
of
conditions
,
for
the
uniformity
of
the
same
types
in
each
continent
during
the
later
tertiary
periods
.
Nor
can
it
be
pretended
that
it
is
an
immutable
law
that
marsupials
should
have
been
chiefly
or
solely
produced
in
Australia
;
or
that
Edentata
and
other
American
types
should
have
been
solely
produced
in
South
America
.
For
we
know
that
Europe
in
ancient
times
was
peopled
by
numerous
marsupials
;
and
I
have
shown
in
the
publications
above
alluded
to
,
that
in
America
the
law
of
distribution
of
terrestrial
mammals
was
formerly
different
from
what
it
now
is
.
North
America
formerly
partook
strongly
of
the
present
character
of
the
southern
half
of
the
continent
;
and
the
southern
half
was
formerly
more
closely
allied
,
than
it
is
at
present
,
to
the
northern
half
.
In
a
similar
manner
we
know
,
from
Falconer
and
Cautley's
discoveries
,
that
Northern
India
was
formerly
more
closely
related
in
its
mammals
to
Africa
than
it
is
at
the
present
time
.
Analogous
facts
could
be
given
in
relation
to
the
distribution
of
marine
animals
.
On
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
,
the
great
law
of
the
long
enduring
,
but
not
immutable
,
succession
of
the
same
types
within
the
same
areas
,
is
at
once
explained
;
for
the
inhabitants
of
each
quarter
of
the
world
will
obviously
tend
to
leave
in
that
quarter
,
during
the
next
succeeding
period
of
time
,
closely
allied
though
in
some
degree
modified
descendants
.
If
the
inhabitants
of
one
continent
formerly
differed
greatly
from
those
of
another
continent
,
so
will
their
modified
descendants
still
differ
in
nearly
the
same
manner
and
degree
.
But
after
very
long
intervals
of
time
,
and
after
great
geographical
changes
,
permitting
much
intermigration
,
the
feebler
will
yield
to
the
more
dominant
forms
,
and
there
will
be
nothing
immutable
in
the
distribution
of
organic
beings
.
It
may
be
asked
in
ridicule
,
whether
I
suppose
that
the
Megatherium
and
other
allied
huge
monsters
,
which
formerly
lived
in
South
America
,
have
left
behind
them
the
sloth
,
armadillo
,
and
anteater
,
as
their
degenerate
descendants
.
This
cannot
for
an
instant
be
admitted
.
These
huge
animals
have
become
wholly
extinct
,
and
have
left
no
progeny
.
But
in
the
caves
of
Brazil
,
there
are
many
extinct
species
which
are
closely
allied
in
size
and
in
all
other
characters
to
the
species
still
living
in
South
America
;
and
some
of
these
fossils
may
have
been
the
actual
progenitors
of
the
living
species
.
It
must
not
be
forgotten
that
,
on
our
theory
,
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
are
the
descendants
of
some
one
species
;
so
that
,
if
six
genera
,
each
having
eight
species
,
be
found
in
one
geological
formation
,
and
in
a
succeeding
formation
there
be
six
other
allied
or
representative
genera
each
with
the
same
number
of
species
,
then
we
may
conclude
that
generally
only
one
species
of
each
of
the
older
genera
has
left
modified
descendants
,
which
constitute
the
new
genera
containing
the
several
species
;
the
other
seven
species
of
each
old
genus
having
died
out
and
left
no
progeny
.
Or
,
and
this
will
be
a
far
commoner
case
,
two
or
three
species
in
two
or
three
alone
of
the
six
older
genera
will
be
the
parents
of
the
new
genera
:
the
other
species
and
the
other
old
genera
having
become
utterly
extinct
.
In
failing
orders
,
with
the
genera
and
species
decreasing
in
numbers
as
is
the
case
with
the
Edentata
of
South
America
,
still
fewer
genera
and
species
will
leave
modified
blood
descendants
.
Summary
of
the
preceding
and
present
Chapters
I
have
attempted
to
show
that
the
geological
record
is
extremely
imperfect
;
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
globe
has
been
geologically
explored
with
care
;
that
only
certain
classes
of
organic
beings
have
been
largely
preserved
in
a
fossil
state
;
that
the
number
both
of
specimens
and
of
species
,
preserved
in
our
museums
,
is
absolutely
as
nothing
compared
with
the
number
of
generations
which
must
have
passed
away
even
during
a
single
formation
;
that
,
owing
to
subsidence
being
almost
necessary
for
the
accumulation
of
deposits
rich
in
fossil
species
of
many
kinds
,
and
thick
enough
to
outlast
future
degradation
,
great
intervals
of
time
must
have
elapsed
between
most
of
our
successive
formations
;
that
there
has
probably
been
more
extinction
during
the
periods
of
subsidence
,
and
more
variation
during
the
periods
of
elevation
,
and
during
the
latter
the
record
will
have
been
less
perfectly
kept
;
that
each
single
formation
has
not
been
continuously
deposited
;
that
the
duration
of
each
formation
is
probably
short
compared
with
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
;
that
migration
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
first
appearance
of
new
forms
in
any
one
area
and
formation
;
that
widely
ranging
species
are
those
which
have
varied
most
frequently
,
and
have
oftenest
given
rise
to
new
species
;
that
varieties
have
at
first
been
local
;
and
lastly
,
although
each
species
must
have
passed
through
numerous
transitional
stages
,
it
is
probable
that
the
periods
,
during
which
each
underwent
modification
,
though
many
and
long
as
measured
by
years
,
have
been
short
in
comparison
with
the
periods
during
which
each
remained
in
an
unchanged
condition
.
These
causes
,
taken
conjointly
,
will
to
a
large
extent
explain
why
though
we
do
find
many
links
we
do
not
find
interminable
varieties
,
connecting
together
all
extinct
and
existing
forms
by
the
finest
graduated
steps
.
It
should
also
be
constantly
borne
in
mind
that
any
linking
variety
between
two
forms
,
which
might
be
found
,
would
be
ranked
,
unless
the
whole
chain
could
be
perfectly
restored
,
as
a
new
and
distinct
species
;
for
it
is
not
pretended
that
we
have
any
sure
criterion
by
which
species
and
varieties
can
be
discriminated
.
He
who
rejects
this
view
of
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
,
will
rightly
reject
the
whole
theory
.
For
he
may
ask
in
vain
where
are
the
numberless
transitional
links
which
must
formerly
have
connected
the
closely
allied
or
representative
species
,
found
in
the
successive
stages
of
the
same
great
formation
?
He
may
disbelieve
in
the
immense
intervals
of
time
which
must
have
elapsed
between
our
consecutive
formations
;
he
may
overlook
how
important
a
part
migration
has
played
,
when
the
formations
of
any
one
great
region
,
as
those
of
Europe
,
are
considered
;
he
may
urge
the
apparent
,
but
often
falsely
apparent
,
sudden
coming
in
of
whole
groups
of
species
.
He
may
ask
where
are
the
remains
of
those
infinitely
numerous
organisms
which
must
have
existed
long
before
the
Cambrian
system
was
deposited
?
We
now
know
that
at
least
one
animal
did
then
exist
;
but
I
can
answer
this
last
,
question
only
by
supposing
that
where
our
oceans
now
extend
they
have
extended
for
an
enormous
period
,
and
where
our
oscillating
continents
now
stand
they
have
stood
since
the
commencement
of
the
Cambrian
system
;
but
that
,
long
before
that
epoch
,
the
world
presented
a
widely
different
aspect
;
and
that
the
older
continents
formed
of
formations
older
than
any
known
to
us
,
exist
now
only
as
remnants
in
a
metamorphosed
condition
,
or
lie
still
buried
under
the
ocean
.
Passing
from
these
difficulties
,
the
other
great
leading
facts
in
palaeontology
agree
admirably
with
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection
.
We
can
thus
understand
how
it
is
that
new
species
come
in
slowly
and
successively
;
how
species
of
different
classes
do
not
necessarily
change
together
,
or
at
the
same
rate
,
or
in
the
same
degree
;
yet
in
the
long
run
that
all
undergo
modification
to
some
extent
.
The
extinction
of
old
forms
is
the
almost
inevitable
consequence
of
the
productions
of
new
forms
.
We
can
understand
why
,
when
a
species
has
once
disappeared
,
it
never
reappears
.
Groups
of
species
increase
in
numbers
slowly
,
and
endure
for
unequal
periods
of
time
;
for
the
process
of
modification
is
necessarily
slow
,
and
depends
on
many
complex
contingencies
.
The
dominant
species
belonging
to
large
and
dominant
groups
tend
to
leave
many
modified
descendants
,
which
form
new
sub
groups
and
groups
.
As
these
are
formed
,
the
species
of
the
less
vigorous
groups
,
from
their
inferiority
inherited
from
a
common
progenitor
,
tend
to
become
extinct
together
,
and
to
leave
no
modified
offspring
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
But
the
utter
extinction
of
a
whole
group
of
species
has
sometimes
been
a
slow
process
,
from
the
survival
of
a
few
descendants
,
lingering
in
protected
and
isolated
situations
.
When
a
group
has
once
wholly
disappeared
,
it
does
not
reappear
;
for
the
link
of
generation
has
been
broken
.
We
can
understand
how
it
is
that
dominant
forms
which
spread
widely
and
yield
the
greatest
number
of
varieties
tend
to
people
the
world
with
allied
,
but
modified
,
descendants
;
and
these
will
generally
succeed
in
displacing
the
groups
which
are
their
inferiors
in
the
struggle
for
existence
.
Hence
,
after
long
intervals
of
time
,
the
productions
of
the
world
appear
to
have
changed
simultaneously
.
We
can
understand
how
it
is
that
all
the
forms
of
life
,
ancient
and
recent
,
make
together
a
few
grand
classes
.
We
can
understand
,
from
the
continued
tendency
to
divergence
of
character
,
why
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
,
the
more
it
generally
differs
from
those
now
living
;
why
ancient
and
extinct
forms
often
tend
to
fill
up
gaps
between
existing
forms
,
sometimes
blending
two
groups
,
previously
classed
as
distinct
,
into
one
;
but
more
commonly
bringing
them
only
a
little
closer
together
.
The
more
ancient
a
form
is
,
the
more
often
it
stands
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
groups
now
distinct
;
for
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
,
the
more
nearly
it
will
be
related
to
,
and
consequently
resemble
,
the
common
progenitor
of
groups
,
since
become
widely
divergent
.
Extinct
forms
are
seldom
directly
intermediate
between
existing
forms
;
but
are
intermediate
only
by
a
long
and
circuitous
course
through
other
extinct
and
different
forms
.
We
can
clearly
see
why
the
organic
remains
of
closely
consecutive
formations
are
closely
allied
;
for
they
are
closely
linked
together
by
generation
.
We
can
clearly
see
why
the
remains
of
an
intermediate
formation
are
intermediate
in
character
.
The
inhabitants
of
the
world
at
each
successive
period
in
its
history
have
beaten
their
predecessors
in
the
race
for
life
,
and
are
,
in
so
far
,
higher
in
the
scale
,
and
their
structure
has
generally
become
more
specialised
;
and
this
may
account
for
the
common
belief
held
by
so
many
palaeontologists
,
that
organisation
on
the
whole
has
progressed
.
Extinct
and
ancient
animals
resemble
to
a
certain
extent
the
embryos
of
the
more
recent
animals
belonging
to
the
same
classes
,
and
this
wonderful
fact
receives
a
simple
explanation
according
to
our
views
.
The
succession
of
the
same
types
of
structure
within
the
same
areas
during
the
later
geological
periods
ceases
to
be
mysterious
,
and
is
intelligible
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
.
If
then
the
geological
record
be
as
imperfect
as
many
believe
,
and
it
may
at
least
be
asserted
that
the
record
cannot
be
proved
to
be
much
more
perfect
,
the
main
objections
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
are
greatly
diminished
or
disappear
.
On
the
other
hand
,
an
the
chief
laws
of
palaeontology
plainly
proclaim
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
that
species
have
been
produced
by
ordinary
generation
:
old
forms
having
been
supplanted
by
new
and
improved
forms
of
life
,
the
products
of
Variation
and
the
Survival
of
the
Fittest
.
CHAPTER
XII
GEOGRAPHICAL
DISTRIBUTION
IN
considering
the
distribution
of
organic
beings
over
the
face
of
the
globe
,
the
first
great
fact
which
strikes
us
is
,
that
neither
the
similarity
nor
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
various
regions
can
be
wholly
accounted
for
by
climatal
and
other
physical
conditions
.
Of
late
,
almost
every
author
who
has
studied
the
subject
has
come
to
this
conclusion
.
The
case
of
America
alone
would
almost
suffice
to
prove
its
truth
;
for
if
we
exclude
the
arctic
and
northern
temperate
parts
,
all
authors
agree
that
one
of
the
most
fundamental
divisions
in
geographical
distribution
is
that
between
the
New
and
Old
Worlds
;
yet
if
we
travel
over
the
vast
American
continent
,
from
the
central
parts
of
the
United
States
to
its
extreme
southern
point
,
we
meet
with
the
most
diversified
conditions
;
humid
districts
,
arid
deserts
,
lofty
mountains
,
grassy
plains
,
forests
,
marshes
,
lakes
,
and
great
rivers
,
under
almost
every
temperature
.
There
is
hardly
a
climate
or
condition
in
the
Old
World
which
cannot
be
paralleled
in
the
New
at
least
as
closely
as
the
same
species
generally
require
.
No
doubt
small
areas
can
be
pointed
out
in
the
Old
World
hotter
than
any
in
the
New
World
;
but
these
are
not
inhabited
by
a
fauna
different
from
that
of
the
surrounding
districts
;
for
it
is
rare
to
find
a
group
of
organisms
confined
to
a
small
area
,
of
which
the
conditions
are
peculiar
in
only
a
slight
degree
.
Notwithstanding
this
general
parallelism
in
the
conditions
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
,
how
widely
different
are
their
living
productions!
In
the
southern
hemisphere
,
if
we
compare
large
tracts
of
land
in
Australia
,
South
Africa
,
and
western
South
America
,
between
latitudes
25
and
35
,
we
shall
find
parts
extremely
similar
in
all
their
conditions
,
yet
it
would
not
be
possible
to
point
out
three
faunas
and
floras
more
utterly
dissimilar
.
Or
,
again
,
we
may
compare
the
productions
of
South
America
south
of
lat
.
35
with
those
north
of
25
,
which
consequently
are
separated
by
a
space
of
ten
degrees
of
latitude
,
and
are
exposed
to
considerably
different
conditions
;
yet
they
are
incomparably
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
they
are
to
the
productions
of
Australia
or
Africa
under
nearly
the
same
climate
.
Analogous
facts
could
be
given
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
.
A
second
great
fact
which
strikes
us
in
our
general
review
is
,
that
barriers
of
any
kind
,
or
obstacles
to
free
migration
,
are
related
in
a
close
and
important
manner
to
the
differences
between
the
productions
of
various
regions
.
We
see
this
in
the
great
difference
in
nearly
all
the
terrestrial
productions
of
the
New
and
Old
Worlds
,
excepting
in
the
northern
parts
,
where
the
land
almost
joins
,
and
where
,
under
a
slightly
different
climate
,
there
might
have
been
free
migration
for
the
northern
temperate
forms
,
as
there
now
is
for
the
strictly
arctic
productions
.
We
see
the
same
fact
in
the
great
difference
between
the
inhabitants
of
Australia
,
Africa
,
and
South
America
under
the
same
latitude
;
for
these
countries
are
almost
as
much
isolated
from
each
other
as
is
possible
.
On
each
continent
,
also
,
we
see
the
same
fact
;
for
on
the
opposite
sides
of
lofty
and
continuous
mountain
ranges
,
of
great
deserts
and
even
of
large
rivers
,
we
find
different
productions
;
though
as
mountain
chains
,
deserts
,
&c
.
,
are
not
as
impassable
,
or
likely
to
have
endured
so
long
,
as
the
oceans
separating
continents
,
the
differences
are
very
inferior
in
degree
to
those
characteristic
of
distinct
continents
.
Turning
to
the
sea
,
we
find
the
same
law
.
The
marine
inhabitants
of
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
South
America
are
very
distinct
,
with
extremely
few
shells
,
Crustacea
,
or
Echinodermata
in
common
;
but
Dr
.
Gunther
has
recently
shown
that
about
thirty
per
cent
.
of
the
fishes
are
the
same
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
isthmus
of
Panama
;
and
this
fact
has
led
naturalists
to
believe
that
the
isthmus
was
formerly
open
.
Westward
of
the
shores
of
America
,
a
wide
space
of
open
ocean
extends
,
with
not
an
island
as
a
halting
place
for
emigrants
;
here
we
have
a
barrier
of
another
kind
,
and
as
soon
as
this
is
passed
we
meet
in
the
eastern
islands
of
the
Pacific
with
another
and
totally
distinct
fauna
.
So
that
three
marine
faunas
range
far
northward
and
southward
in
parallel
lines
not
far
from
each
other
,
under
corresponding
climates
;
but
from
being
separated
from
each
other
by
impassable
barriers
,
either
of
land
or
open
sea
,
they
are
almost
wholly
distinct
.
On
the
other
hand
,
proceeding
still
farther
westward
from
the
eastern
islands
of
the
tropical
parts
of
the
Pacific
,
we
encounter
no
impassable
barriers
,
and
we
have
innumerable
islands
as
halting
places
,
or
continuous
coasts
,
until
,
after
travelling
over
a
hemisphere
,
we
come
to
the
shores
of
Africa
;
and
over
this
vast
space
we
meet
with
no
well
defined
and
distinct
marine
faunas
.
Although
so
few
marine
animals
are
common
to
the
above
named
three
approximate
faunas
of
eastern
and
western
America
and
the
eastern
Pacific
islands
,
yet
many
fishes
range
from
the
Pacific
into
the
Indian
Ocean
,
and
many
shells
are
common
to
the
eastern
islands
of
the
Pacific
and
the
eastern
shores
of
Africa
on
almost
exactly
opposite
meridians
of
longitude
.
A
third
great
fact
,
partly
included
in
the
foregoing
statement
,
is
the
affinity
of
the
productions
of
the
same
continent
or
of
the
same
sea
,
though
the
species
themselves
are
distinct
at
different
points
and
stations
.
It
is
a
law
of
the
widest
generality
,
and
every
continent
offers
innumerable
instances
.
Nevertheless
the
naturalist
,
in
travelling
,
for
instance
,
from
north
to
south
,
never
fails
to
be
struck
by
the
manner
in
which
successive
groups
of
beings
,
specifically
distinct
,
though
nearly
related
,
replace
each
other
.
He
hears
from
closely
allied
,
yet
distinct
kinds
of
birds
,
notes
nearly
similar
,
and
sees
their
nests
similarly
constructed
,
but
not
quite
alike
,
with
eggs
coloured
in
nearly
the
same
manner
.
The
plains
near
the
Straits
of
Magellan
are
inhabited
by
one
species
of
Rhea
(
American
ostrich
)
and
northward
the
plains
of
La
Plata
by
another
species
of
the
same
genus
;
and
not
by
a
true
ostrich
or
emu
,
like
those
inhabiting
Africa
and
Australia
under
the
same
latitude
.
On
these
same
plains
of
La
Plata
we
see
the
agouti
and
bizcacha
,
animals
having
nearly
the
same
habits
as
our
hares
and
rabbits
,
and
belonging
to
the
same
order
of
rodents
,
but
they
plainly
display
an
American
type
of
structure
.
We
ascend
the
lofty
peaks
of
the
Cordillera
,
and
we
find
an
alpine
species
of
bizcacha
;
we
look
to
the
waters
,
and
we
do
not
find
the
beaver
or
musk
rat
,
but
the
coypu
and
capybara
,
rodents
of
the
S
.
American
type
.
Innumerable
other
instances
could
be
given
.
If
we
look
to
the
islands
off
the
American
shore
,
however
much
they
may
differ
in
geological
structure
,
the
inhabitants
are
essentially
American
,
though
they
may
be
all
peculiar
species
.
We
may
look
back
to
past
ages
,
as
shown
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
we
find
American
types
then
prevailing
on
the
American
continent
and
in
the
American
seas
.
We
see
in
these
facts
some
deep
organic
bond
,
throughout
space
and
time
,
over
the
same
areas
of
land
and
water
,
independently
of
physical
conditions
.
The
naturalist
must
be
dull
who
is
not
led
to
enquire
what
this
bond
is
.
The
bond
is
simply
inheritance
,
that
cause
which
alone
,
as
far
as
we
positively
know
,
produces
organisms
quite
like
each
other
,
or
,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
varieties
,
nearly
alike
.
The
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
different
regions
may
be
attributed
to
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection
,
and
probably
in
a
subordinate
degree
to
the
definite
influence
of
different
physical
conditions
.
The
degrees
of
dissimilarity
will
depend
on
the
migration
of
the
more
dominant
forms
of
life
from
one
region
into
another
having
been
more
or
less
effectually
prevented
,
at
periods
more
or
less
remote
;
on
the
nature
and
number
of
the
former
immigrants
;
and
on
the
action
of
the
inhabitants
on
each
other
in
leading
to
the
preservation
of
different
modifications
;
the
relation
of
organism
to
organism
in
the
struggle
for
life
being
,
as
I
have
already
often
remarked
,
the
most
important
of
all
relations
.
Thus
the
high
importance
of
barriers
comes
into
play
by
checking
migration
;
as
does
time
for
the
slow
process
of
modification
through
natural
selection
.
Widely
ranging
species
,
abounding
in
individuals
,
which
have
already
triumphed
over
many
competitors
in
their
own
widely
extended
homes
,
will
have
the
best
chance
of
seizing
on
new
places
,
when
they
spread
into
new
countries
.
In
their
new
homes
they
will
be
exposed
to
new
conditions
,
and
will
frequently
undergo
further
modification
and
improvement
;
and
thus
they
will
become
still
further
victorious
,
and
will
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
.
On
this
principle
of
inheritance
with
modification
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
sections
of
genera
,
whole
genera
,
and
even
families
,
are
confined
to
the
same
areas
,
as
is
so
commonly
and
notoriously
the
case
.
There
is
no
evidence
,
as
was
remarked
in
the
last
chapter
,
of
the
existence
of
any
law
of
necessary
development
.
As
the
variability
of
each
species
is
an
independent
property
,
and
will
be
taken
advantage
of
by
natural
selection
,
only
so
far
as
it
profits
each
individual
in
its
complex
struggle
for
life
,
so
the
amount
of
modification
in
different
species
will
be
no
uniform
quantity
.
If
a
number
of
species
,
after
having
long
competed
with
each
other
in
their
old
home
,
were
to
migrate
in
a
body
into
a
new
and
afterwards
isolated
country
,
they
would
be
little
liable
to
modification
;
for
neither
migration
nor
isolation
in
themselves
effect
anything
.
These
principles
come
into
play
only
by
bringing
organisms
into
new
relations
with
each
other
and
in
a
lesser
degree
with
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
.
As
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
some
forms
have
retained
nearly
the
same
character
from
an
enormously
remote
geological
period
,
so
certain
species
have
migrated
over
vast
spaces
,
and
have
not
become
greatly
or
at
all
modified
.
According
to
these
views
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
,
though
inhabiting
the
most
distant
quarters
of
the
world
,
must
originally
have
proceeded
from
the
same
source
,
as
they
are
descended
from
the
same
progenitor
.
In
the
case
of
those
species
which
have
undergone
during
the
whole
geological
periods
little
modification
,
there
is
not
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
they
have
migrated
from
,
the
same
region
;
for
during
the
vast
geographical
and
climatal
changes
which
have
supervened
since
ancient
times
,
almost
any
amount
of
migration
is
possible
.
But
in
many
other
cases
,
in
which
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
species
of
a
genus
have
been
produced
within
comparatively
recent
times
,
there
is
great
difficulty
on
this
head
.
It
is
also
obvious
that
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
though
now
inhabiting
distant
and
isolated
regions
,
must
have
proceeded
from
one
spot
,
where
their
parents
were
first
produced
:
for
,
as
has
been
explained
,
it
is
incredible
that
individuals
identically
the
same
should
have
been
produced
from
parents
specifically
distinct
.
Single
Centres
of
supposed
Creation
.
We
are
thus
brought
to
the
question
which
has
been
largely
discussed
by
naturalists
,
namely
,
whether
species
have
been
created
at
one
or
more
points
of
the
earth's
surface
.
Undoubtedly
there
are
many
cases
of
extreme
difficulty
in
understanding
how
the
same
species
could
possibly
have
migrated
from
some
one
point
to
the
several
distant
and
isolated
points
,
where
now
found
.
Nevertheless
the
simplicity
of
the
view
that
each
species
was
first
produced
within
a
single
region
captivates
the
mind
.
He
who
rejects
it
,
rejects
the
vera
causa
of
ordinary
generation
with
subsequent
migration
,
and
calls
in
the
agency
of
a
miracle
.
It
is
universally
admitted
,
that
in
most
cases
the
area
inhabited
by
a
species
is
continuous
;
and
that
when
a
plant
or
animal
inhabits
two
points
so
distant
from
each
other
,
or
with
an
interval
of
such
a
nature
,
that
the
space
could
not
have
been
easily
passed
over
by
migration
,
the
fact
is
given
as
something
remarkable
and
exceptional
.
The
incapacity
of
migrating
across
a
wide
sea
is
more
clear
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
mammals
than
perhaps
with
any
other
organic
beings
;
and
,
accordingly
,
we
find
no
inexplicable
instances
of
the
same
mammals
inhabiting
distant
points
of
the
world
.
No
geologist
feels
any
difficulty
in
Great
Britain
possessing
the
same
quadrupeds
with
the
rest
of
Europe
,
for
they
were
no
doubt
once
united
.
But
if
the
same
species
can
be
produced
at
two
separate
points
,
why
do
we
not
find
a
single
mammal
common
to
Europe
and
Australia
or
South
America
?
The
conditions
of
life
are
nearly
the
same
,
so
that
a
multitude
of
European
animals
and
plants
have
become
naturalised
in
America
and
Australia
;
and
some
of
the
aboriginal
plants
are
identically
the
same
at
these
distant
points
of
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
.
The
answer
,
as
I
believe
,
is
,
that
mammals
have
not
been
able
to
migrate
,
whereas
some
plants
,
from
their
varied
means
of
dispersal
,
have
migrated
across
the
wide
and
broken
interspaces
.
The
great
and
striking
influence
of
barriers
of
all
kinds
,
is
intelligible
only
on
the
view
that
the
great
majority
of
species
have
been
produced
on
one
side
,
and
have
not
been
able
to
migrate
to
the
opposite
side
.
Some
few
families
,
many
sub
families
,
very
many
genera
,
and
a
still
greater
number
of
sections
of
genera
,
are
confined
to
a
single
region
;
and
it
has
been
observed
by
several
naturalists
that
the
most
natural
genera
,
or
those
genera
in
which
the
species
are
most
closely
related
to
each
other
,
are
generally
confined
to
the
same
,
country
,
or
if
they
have
a
wide
range
that
their
range
is
continuous
.
What
a
strange
anomaly
it
would
be
,
if
a
directly
opposite
rule
were
to
prevail
,
when
we
go
down
one
step
lower
in
the
series
,
namely
,
to
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
these
had
not
been
,
at
least
at
first
,
confined
to
some
one
region!
Hence
it
seems
to
me
,
as
it
has
to
many
other
naturalists
,
that
the
view
of
each
species
having
been
produced
in
one
area
alone
,
and
having
subsequently
migrated
from
that
area
as
far
as
its
powers
of
migration
and
subsistence
under
past
and
present
conditions
permitted
,
is
the
most
probable
.
Undoubtedly
many
cases
occur
,
in
which
we
cannot
explain
how
the
same
species
could
have
passed
from
one
point
to
the
other
.
But
the
geographical
and
climatal
changes
which
have
certainly
occurred
within
recent
geological
times
,
must
have
rendered
discontinuous
the
formerly
continuous
range
of
many
species
.
So
that
we
are
reduced
to
consider
whether
the
exceptions
to
continuity
of
range
are
so
numerous
and
of
so
grave
a
nature
,
that
we
ought
to
give
up
the
belief
,
rendered
probable
by
general
considerations
,
that
each
species
has
been
produced
within
one
area
,
and
has
migrated
thence
as
far
as
it
could
.
It
would
be
hopelessly
tedious
to
discuss
all
the
exceptional
cases
of
the
same
species
,
now
living
at
distant
and
separated
points
,
nor
do
I
for
a
moment
pretend
that
any
explanation
could
be
offered
of
many
instances
.
But
,
after
some
preliminary
remarks
,
I
will
discuss
a
few
of
the
most
striking
classes
of
facts
;
namely
,
the
existence
of
the
same
species
on
the
summits
of
distant
mountain
ranges
,
and
at
distant
points
in
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
;
and
secondly
(
in
the
following
chapter
)
,
the
wide
distribution
of
fresh
water
productions
;
and
thirdly
,
the
occurrence
of
the
same
terrestrial
species
on
islands
and
on
the
nearest
mainland
,
though
separated
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
sea
.
If
the
existence
of
the
same
species
at
distant
and
isolated
points
of
the
earth's
surface
,
can
in
many
instances
be
explained
on
the
view
of
each
species
having
migrated
from
a
single
birthplace
;
then
,
considering
our
ignorance
with
respect
to
former
climatal
and
geographical
changes
and
to
the
various
occasional
means
of
