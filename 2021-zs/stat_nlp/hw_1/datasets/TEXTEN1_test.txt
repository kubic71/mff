and
used
for
another
purpose
.
An
organ
might
,
also
,
be
retained
for
one
alone
of
its
former
functions
.
Organs
,
originally
formed
by
the
aid
of
natural
selection
,
when
rendered
useless
may
well
be
variable
,
for
their
variations
can
no
longer
be
cheeked
by
natural
selection
.
All
this
agrees
well
with
what
we
see
under
nature
.
Moreover
,
at
whatever
period
of
life
either
disuse
or
selection
reduces
an
organ
,
and
this
will
generally
be
when
the
being
has
come
to
maturity
and
has
to
exert
its
full
powers
of
action
,
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
will
tend
to
reproduce
the
organ
in
its
reduced
state
at
the
same
mature
age
,
but
will
seldom
effect
it
in
the
embryo
.
Thus
we
can
understand
the
greater
size
of
rudimentary
organs
in
the
embryo
relatively
to
the
adjoining
parts
.
and
their
lesser
relative
size
in
the
adult
.
If
,
for
instance
,
the
digit
of
an
adult
animal
was
used
less
and
less
during
many
generations
,
owing
to
some
change
of
habits
,
or
if
an
organ
or
gland
was
less
and
less
functionally
exercised
,
we
may
infer
that
it
would
become
reduced
in
size
in
the
adult
descendants
of
this
animal
,
but
would
retain
nearly
its
original
standard
of
development
in
the
embryo
.
There
remains
,
however
,
this
difficulty
.
After
an
organ
has
ceased
being
used
,
and
has
become
in
consequence
much
reduced
,
how
can
it
be
still
further
reduced
in
size
until
the
merest
vestige
is
left
;
and
how
can
it
be
finally
quite
obliterated
?
It
is
scarcely
possible
that
disuse
can
go
on
producing
any
further
effect
after
the
organ
has
once
been
rendered
functionless
.
Some
additional
explanation
is
here
requisite
which
I
cannot
give
.
If
,
for
instance
,
it
could
be
proved
that
every
part
of
the
organisation
tends
to
vary
in
a
greater
degree
towards
diminution
than
towards
augmentation
of
size
,
then
we
should
be
able
to
understand
how
an
organ
which
has
become
useless
would
be
rendered
,
independently
of
the
effects
of
disuse
,
rudimentary
and
would
at
last
be
wholly
suppressed
;
for
the
variations
towards
diminished
size
would
no
longer
be
checked
by
natural
selection
.
The
principle
of
the
economy
of
growth
,
explained
in
a
former
chapter
,
by
which
the
materials
forming
any
part
,
if
not
useful
to
the
possessor
,
are
saved
as
far
as
possible
,
will
perhaps
come
into
play
in
rendering
a
useless
part
rudimentary
.
But
this
principle
will
almost
necessarily
be
confined
to
the
earlier
stages
of
the
process
of
reduction
;
for
we
cannot
suppose
that
a
minute
papilla
,
for
instance
,
representing
in
a
male
flower
the
pistil
of
the
female
flower
,
and
formed
merely
of
cellular
tissue
,
could
be
further
reduced
or
absorbed
for
the
sake
of
economising
nutriment
.
Finally
,
as
rudimentary
organs
,
by
whatever
steps
they
may
have
been
degraded
into
their
present
useless
condition
,
are
the
record
of
a
former
state
of
things
,
and
have
been
retained
solely
through
the
power
of
inheritance
,
we
can
understand
,
on
the
genealogical
view
of
classification
,
how
it
is
that
systematists
,
in
placing
organisms
in
their
proper
places
in
the
natural
system
,
have
often
found
rudimentary
parts
as
useful
as
,
or
even
sometimes
more
useful
than
,
parts
of
high
physiological
importance
.
Rudimentary
organs
may
be
compared
with
the
letters
in
a
word
,
still
retained
in
the
spelling
,
but
become
useless
in
the
pronunciation
,
but
which
serve
as
a
clue
for
its
derivation
.
On
the
view
of
descent
with
modification
,
we
may
conclude
that
the
existence
of
organs
in
a
rudimentary
,
imperfect
,
and
useless
condition
,
or
quite
aborted
,
far
from
presenting
a
strange
difficulty
,
as
they
assuredly
do
on
the
old
doctrine
of
creation
,
might
even
have
been
anticipated
in
accordance
with
the
views
here
explained
.
Summary
In
this
chapter
I
have
attempted
to
show
,
that
the
arrangement
of
all
organic
beings
throughout
all
time
in
groups
under
groups
that
the
nature
of
the
relationships
by
which
all
living
and
extinct
organisms
are
united
by
complex
,
radiating
,
and
circuitous
lines
of
affinities
into
a
few
grand
classes
,
the
rules
followed
and
the
difficulties
encountered
by
naturalists
in
their
classifications
,
the
value
set
upon
characters
,
if
constant
and
prevalent
,
whether
of
high
or
of
the
most
trifling
importance
,
or
,
as
with
rudimentary
organs
,
of
no
importance
,
the
wide
opposition
in
value
between
analogical
or
adaptive
characters
,
and
characters
of
true
affinity
;
and
other
such
rules
;
all
naturally
follow
if
we
admit
the
common
parentage
of
allied
forms
,
together
with
their
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection
,
with
the
contingencies
of
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
.
In
considering
this
view
of
classification
,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
element
of
descent
has
been
universally
used
in
ranking
together
the
sexes
,
ages
,
dimorphic
forms
,
and
acknowledged
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
structure
.
If
we
extend
the
use
of
this
element
of
descent
,
the
one
certainly
known
cause
of
similarity
in
organic
beings
,
we
shall
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
Natural
System
:
it
is
genealogical
in
its
attempted
arrangement
,
with
the
grades
of
acquired
difference
marked
by
the
terms
,
varieties
,
species
,
genera
,
families
,
orders
,
and
classes
.
On
this
same
view
of
descent
with
modification
,
most
of
the
great
facts
in
Morphology
become
intelligible
,
whether
we
look
to
the
same
pattern
displayed
by
the
different
species
of
the
same
class
in
their
homologous
organs
,
to
whatever
purpose
applied
;
or
to
the
serial
and
lateral
homologies
in
each
individual
animal
and
plant
.
On
the
principle
of
successive
slight
variations
,
not
necessarily
or
generally
supervening
at
a
very
early
period
of
life
,
and
being
inherited
at
a
corresponding
period
,
we
can
understand
the
leading
facts
in
Embryology
;
namely
,
the
close
resemblance
in
the
individual
embryo
of
the
parts
which
are
homologous
,
and
which
when
matured
become
widely
different
in
structure
and
function
;
and
the
resemblance
of
the
homologous
parts
or
organs
in
allied
though
distinct
species
,
though
fitted
in
the
adult
state
for
habits
as
different
as
is
possible
.
Larvae
are
active
embryos
,
which
have
been
specially
modified
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
in
relation
to
their
habits
of
life
,
with
their
modifications
inherited
at
a
corresponding
early
age
.
On
these
same
principles
,
and
bearing
in
mind
that
when
organs
are
reduced
in
size
,
either
from
disuse
or
through
natural
selection
,
it
will
generally
be
at
that
period
of
life
when
the
being
has
to
provide
for
its
own
wants
,
and
bearing
in
mind
how
strong
is
the
force
of
inheritance
the
occurrence
of
rudimentary
organs
might
even
have
been
anticipated
.
The
importance
of
embryological
characters
and
of
rudimentary
organs
in
classification
is
intelligible
,
on
the
view
that
a
natural
arrangement
must
be
genealogical
.
Finally
,
the
several
classes
of
facts
which
have
been
considered
in
this
chapter
,
seem
to
me
to
proclaim
so
plainly
,
that
the
innumerable
species
,
genera
and
families
,
with
which
this
world
is
peopled
,
are
all
descended
,
each
within
its
own
class
or
group
,
from
common
parents
,
and
have
all
been
modified
in
the
course
of
descent
,
that
I
should
without
hesitation
adopt
this
view
,
even
if
it
were
unsupported
by
other
facts
or
arguments
.
CHAPTER
XV
RECAPITULATION
AND
CONCLUSION
AS
THIS
whole
volume
is
one
long
argument
,
it
may
be
convenient
to
the
reader
to
have
the
leading
facts
and
inferences
briefly
recapitulated
.
That
many
and
serious
objections
may
be
advanced
against
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection
,
I
do
not
deny
.
I
have
endeavoured
to
give
to
them
their
full
force
.
Nothing
at
first
can
appear
more
difficult
to
believe
than
that
the
more
complex
organs
and
instincts
have
been
perfected
,
not
by
means
superior
to
,
though
analogous
with
,
human
reason
,
but
by
the
accumulation
of
innumerable
slight
variations
,
each
good
for
the
individual
possessor
.
Nevertheless
,
this
difficulty
,
though
appearing
to
our
imagination
insuperably
great
,
cannot
be
considered
real
if
we
admit
the
following
propositions
,
namely
,
that
all
parts
of
the
organisation
and
instincts
offer
,
at
least
,
individual
differences
that
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
leading
to
the
preservation
of
profitable
deviations
of
structure
or
instinct
and
,
lastly
,
that
gradations
in
the
state
of
perfection
of
each
organ
may
have
existed
,
each
good
of
its
kind
.
The
truth
of
these
propositions
cannot
,
I
think
,
be
disputed
.
It
is
,
no
doubt
,
extremely
difficult
even
to
conjecture
by
what
gradations
many
structures
have
been
perfected
,
more
especially
amongst
broken
and
failing
groups
of
organic
beings
,
which
have
suffered
much
extinction
,
but
we
see
so
many
strange
gradations
in
nature
,
that
we
ought
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
saying
that
any
organ
or
instinct
,
or
any
whole
structure
,
could
not
have
arrived
at
its
present
state
by
many
graduated
steps
.
There
are
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
cases
of
special
difficulty
opposed
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
;
and
one
of
the
most
curious
of
these
is
the
existence
in
the
same
community
of
two
or
three
defined
castes
of
workers
or
sterile
female
ants
;
but
I
have
attempted
to
show
how
these
difficulties
can
be
mastered
.
With
respect
to
the
almost
universal
sterility
of
species
when
first
crossed
,
which
forms
so
remarkable
a
contrast
with
the
almost
universal
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed
,
I
must
refer
the
reader
to
the
recapitulation
of
the
facts
given
at
the
end
of
the
ninth
chapter
,
which
seem
to
me
conclusively
to
show
that
this
sterility
is
no
more
a
special
endowment
than
is
the
incapacity
of
two
distinct
kinds
of
trees
to
be
grafted
together
;
but
that
it
is
incidental
on
differences
confined
to
the
reproductive
systems
of
the
intercrossed
species
.
We
see
the
truth
of
this
conclusion
in
the
vast
difference
in
the
results
of
crossing
the
same
two
species
reciprocally
,
that
is
,
when
one
species
is
first
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
.
Analogy
from
the
consideration
of
dimorphic
and
trimorphic
plants
clearly
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
,
for
when
the
forms
are
illegitimately
united
,
they
yield
few
or
no
seed
,
and
their
offspring
are
more
or
less
sterile
;
and
these
forms
belong
to
the
same
undoubted
species
,
and
differ
from
each
other
in
no
respect
except
in
their
reproductive
organs
and
functions
.
Although
the
fertility
of
varieties
when
intercrossed
and
of
their
mongrel
offspring
has
been
asserted
by
so
many
authors
to
be
universal
,
this
cannot
be
considered
as
quite
correct
after
the
facts
given
on
the
high
authority
of
Gartner
and
Kolreuter
.
Most
of
the
varieties
which
have
been
experimented
on
have
been
produced
under
domestication
;
and
as
domestication
(
I
do
not
mean
mere
confinement
)
almost
certainly
tends
to
eliminate
that
sterility
which
,
judging
from
analogy
,
would
have
affected
the
parent
species
if
intercrossed
,
we
ought
not
to
expect
that
domestication
would
likewise
induce
sterility
in
their
modified
descendants
when
crossed
.
This
elimination
of
sterility
apparently
follows
from
the
same
cause
which
allows
our
domestic
animals
to
breed
freely
under
diversified
circumstances
;
and
this
again
apparently
follows
from
their
having
been
gradually
accustomed
to
frequent
changes
in
their
conditions
of
life
.
A
double
and
parallel
series
of
facts
seems
to
throw
much
light
on
the
sterility
of
species
,
when
first
crossed
,
and
of
their
hybrid
offspring
.
On
the
one
side
,
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
give
vigour
and
fertility
to
all
organic
beings
.
We
know
also
that
a
cross
between
the
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
variety
,
and
between
distinct
varieties
,
increases
the
number
of
their
offspring
,
and
certainly
gives
to
them
increased
size
and
vigour
.
This
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
forms
which
are
crossed
having
been
exposed
to
somewhat
different
conditions
of
life
;
for
I
have
ascertained
by
a
laborious
series
of
experiments
that
if
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
variety
be
subjected
during
several
generations
to
the
same
conditions
,
the
good
derived
from
crossing
is
often
much
diminished
or
wholly
disappears
.
This
is
one
side
of
the
case
.
On
the
other
side
,
we
know
that
species
which
have
long
been
exposed
to
nearly
uniform
conditions
,
when
they
are
subjected
under
confinement
to
new
and
greatly
changed
conditions
,
either
perish
,
or
if
they
survive
,
are
rendered
sterile
,
though
retaining
perfect
health
.
This
does
not
occur
,
or
only
in
a
very
slight
degree
,
with
our
domesticated
productions
,
which
have
long
been
exposed
to
fluctuating
conditions
.
Hence
when
we
find
that
hybrids
produced
by
a
cross
between
two
distinct
species
are
few
in
number
,
owing
to
their
perishing
soon
after
conception
or
at
a
very
early
age
,
or
if
surviving
that
they
are
rendered
more
or
less
sterile
,
it
seems
highly
probable
that
this
result
is
due
to
their
having
been
in
fact
subjected
to
a
great
change
in
their
conditions
of
life
,
from
being
compounded
of
two
distinct
organisations
.
He
who
will
explain
in
a
definite
manner
why
,
for
instance
,
air
elephant
or
a
fox
will
not
breed
under
confinement
in
its
native
country
,
whilst
the
domestic
pig
or
dog
will
breed
freely
under
the
most
diversified
conditions
,
will
at
the
same
time
be
able
to
give
a
definite
answer
to
the
question
why
two
distinct
species
,
when
crossed
,
as
well
as
their
hybrid
offspring
,
are
generally
rendered
more
or
less
sterile
,
whilst
two
domesticated
varieties
when
crossed
and
their
mongrel
offspring
are
perfectly
fertile
.
Turning
to
geographical
distribution
,
the
difficulties
encountered
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
are
serious
enough
.
All
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
,
or
even
higher
group
,
are
descended
from
common
parents
;
and
therefore
,
in
however
distant
and
isolated
parts
of
the
world
they
may
now
be
found
,
they
must
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
have
travelled
from
some
one
point
to
all
the
others
.
We
are
often
wholly
unable
even
to
conjecture
how
this
could
have
been
effected
.
Yet
,
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
some
species
have
retained
the
same
specific
form
for
very
long
periods
of
time
,
immensely
long
as
measured
by
years
,
too
much
stress
ought
not
to
be
laid
on
the
occasional
wide
diffusion
of
the
same
species
;
for
during
very
long
periods
there
will
always
have
been
a
good
chance
for
wide
migration
by
many
means
.
A
broken
or
interrupted
range
may
often
be
accounted
for
by
the
extinction
of
the
species
in
the
intermediate
regions
.
It
cannot
be
denied
that
we
are
as
yet
very
ignorant
as
to
the
full
extent
of
the
various
climatal
and
geographical
changes
which
have
affected
the
earth
during
modern
periods
;
and
such
changes
will
often
have
facilitated
migration
.
As
an
example
,
I
have
attempted
to
show
how
potent
has
been
the
influence
of
the
Glacial
period
on
the
distribution
of
the
same
and
of
allied
species
throughout
the
world
.
We
are
as
yet
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
many
occasional
means
of
transport
.
With
respect
to
distinct
species
of
the
same
genus
inhabiting
distant
and
isolated
regions
,
as
the
process
of
modification
has
necessarily
been
slow
,
all
the
means
of
migration
will
have
been
possible
during
a
very
long
period
;
and
consequently
the
difficulty
of
the
wide
diffusion
of
the
species
of
the
same
genus
is
in
some
degree
lessened
.
As
according
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
an
interminable
number
of
intermediate
forms
must
have
existed
,
linking
together
all
the
species
in
each
group
by
gradations
as
fine
as
are
our
existing
varieties
,
it
may
be
asked
:
Why
do
we
not
see
these
linking
forms
all
around
us
?
Why
are
not
all
organic
beings
blended
together
in
an
inextricable
chaos
?
With
respect
to
existing
forms
,
we
should
remember
that
we
have
no
right
to
expect
(
excepting
in
rare
cases
)
to
discover
directly
connecting
links
between
them
,
but
only
between
each
and
some
extinct
and
supplanted
form
.
Even
on
a
wide
area
,
which
has
during
a
long
period
remained
continuous
,
and
of
which
the
climatic
and
other
conditions
of
life
change
insensibly
in
proceeding
from
a
district
occupied
by
one
species
into
another
district
occupied
by
a
closely
allied
species
,
we
have
no
just
right
to
expect
often
to
find
intermediate
varieties
in
the
intermediate
zones
.
For
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
only
a
few
species
of
a
genus
ever
undergo
change
;
the
other
species
becoming
utterly
extinct
and
leaving
no
modified
progeny
.
Of
the
species
which
do
change
,
only
a
few
within
the
same
country
change
at
the
same
time
;
and
all
modifications
are
slowly
effected
.
I
have
also
shown
that
the
intermediate
varieties
which
probably
at
first
existed
in
the
intermediate
zones
,
would
be
liable
to
be
supplanted
by
the
allied
forms
on
either
hand
;
for
the
latter
,
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
,
would
generally
be
modified
and
improved
at
a
quicker
rate
than
the
intermediate
varieties
,
which
existed
in
lesser
numbers
;
so
that
the
intermediate
varieties
would
,
in
the
long
run
,
be
supplanted
and
exterminated
.
On
this
doctrine
of
the
extermination
of
an
infinitude
of
connecting
links
,
between
the
living
and
extinct
inhabitants
of
the
world
,
and
at
each
successive
period
between
the
extinct
and
still
older
species
,
why
is
not
every
geological
formation
charged
with
such
links
?
Why
does
not
every
collection
of
fossil
remains
afford
plain
evidence
of
the
gradation
and
mutation
of
the
forms
of
life
?
Although
geological
research
has
undoubtedly
revealed
the
former
existence
of
many
links
,
bringing
numerous
forms
of
life
much
closer
together
,
it
does
not
yield
the
infinitely
many
fine
gradations
between
past
and
present
species
required
on
the
theory
;
and
this
is
the
most
obvious
of
the
many
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
it
.
Why
,
again
,
do
whole
groups
of
allied
species
appear
,
though
this
appearance
is
often
false
,
to
have
come
in
suddenly
on
the
successive
geological
stages
?
Although
we
now
know
that
organic
beings
appeared
on
this
globe
,
at
a
period
incalculably
remote
,
long
before
the
lowest
bed
of
the
Cambrian
system
was
deposited
,
why
do
we
not
find
beneath
this
system
great
piles
of
strata
stored
with
the
remains
of
the
progenitors
of
the
Cambrian
fossils
?
For
on
the
theory
,
such
strata
must
somewhere
have
been
deposited
at
these
ancient
and
utterly
unknown
epochs
of
the
world's
history
.
I
can
answer
these
questions
and
objections
only
on
the
supposition
that
the
geological
record
is
far
more
imperfect
than
most
geologists
believe
.
The
number
of
specimens
in
all
our
museums
is
absolutely
as
nothing
compared
with
the
countless
generations
of
countless
species
which
have
certainly
existed
.
The
parent
form
of
any
two
or
more
species
would
not
be
in
all
its
characters
directly
intermediate
between
its
modified
offspring
,
any
more
than
the
rock
pigeon
is
directly
intermediate
in
crop
and
tail
between
its
descendants
,
the
pouter
and
fantail
pigeons
.
We
should
not
be
able
to
recognise
a
species
as
the
parent
of
another
and
modified
species
,
if
we
were
to
examine
the
two
ever
so
closely
,
unless
we
possessed
most
of
the
intermediate
links
;
and
owing
to
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
,
we
have
no
just
right
to
expect
to
find
so
many
links
.
If
two
or
three
,
or
even
more
linking
forms
were
discovered
,
they
would
simply
be
ranked
by
many
naturalists
as
so
many
new
species
,
more
especially
if
found
in
different
geological
sub
stages
,
let
their
differences
be
ever
so
slight
.
Numerous
existing
doubtful
forms
could
be
named
which
are
probably
varieties
;
but
who
will
pretend
that
in
future
ages
so
many
fossil
links
will
be
discovered
,
that
naturalists
will
be
able
to
decide
whether
or
not
these
doubtful
forms
ought
to
be
called
varieties
?
Only
a
small
portion
of
the
world
has
been
geologically
explored
.
Only
organic
beings
of
certain
classes
can
be
preserved
in
a
fossil
condition
,
at
least
in
any
great
number
.
Many
species
when
once
formed
never
undergo
any
further
change
but
become
extinct
without
leaving
modified
descendants
;
and
the
periods
,
during
which
species
have
undergone
modification
,
though
long
as
measured
by
years
,
have
probably
been
short
in
comparison
with
the
periods
during
which
they
retain
the
same
form
.
It
is
the
dominant
and
widely
ranging
species
which
vary
most
frequently
and
vary
most
,
and
varieties
are
often
at
first
local
both
causes
rendering
the
discovery
of
intermediate
links
in
any
one
formation
less
likely
.
Local
varieties
will
not
spread
into
other
and
distant
regions
until
they
are
considerably
modified
and
improved
;
and
when
they
have
spread
,
and
are
discovered
in
a
geological
formation
,
they
appear
as
if
suddenly
created
there
,
and
will
be
simply
classed
as
new
species
.
Most
formations
have
been
intermittent
in
their
accumulation
;
and
their
duration
has
probably
been
shorter
than
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
.
Successive
formations
are
in
most
cases
separated
from
each
other
by
blank
intervals
of
time
of
great
length
;
for
fossiliferous
formations
thick
enough
to
resist
future
degradations
can
as
a
general
rule
be
accumulated
only
where
much
sediment
is
deposited
on
the
subsiding
bed
of
the
sea
.
During
the
alternate
periods
of
elevation
and
of
stationary
level
the
record
will
generally
be
blank
.
During
these
latter
periods
there
will
probably
be
more
variability
in
the
forms
of
life
;
during
periods
of
subsidence
,
more
extinction
.
With
respect
to
the
absence
of
strata
rich
in
fossils
beneath
the
Cambrian
formation
,
I
can
recur
only
to
the
hypothesis
given
in
the
tenth
chapter
;
namely
,
that
though
our
continents
and
oceans
have
endured
for
an
enormous
period
in
nearly
their
present
relative
positions
,
we
have
no
reason
to
assume
that
this
has
always
been
the
case
;
consequently
formations
much
older
than
any
now
known
may
lie
buried
beneath
the
great
oceans
.
With
respect
to
the
lapse
of
time
not
having
been
sufficient
since
our
planet
was
consolidated
for
the
assumed
amount
of
organic
change
,
and
this
objection
,
as
urged
by
Sir
William
Thompson
,
is
probably
one
of
the
gravest
as
yet
advanced
,
I
can
only
say
,
firstly
,
that
we
do
not
know
at
what
rate
species
change
as
measured
by
years
,
and
secondly
,
that
many
philosophers
are
not
as
yet
willing
to
admit
that
we
know
enough
of
the
constitution
of
the
universe
and
of
the
interior
of
our
globe
to
speculate
with
safety
on
its
past
duration
.
That
the
geological
record
is
imperfect
all
will
admit
;
but
that
it
is
imperfect
to
the
degree
required
by
our
theory
,
few
will
be
inclined
to
admit
.
If
we
look
to
long
enough
intervals
of
time
,
geology
plainly
declares
that
species
have
all
changed
;
and
they
have
changed
in
the
manner
required
by
the
theory
,
for
they
have
changed
slowly
and
in
a
graduated
manner
.
We
clearly
see
this
in
the
fossil
remains
from
consecutive
formations
invariably
being
much
more
closely
related
to
each
other
,
than
are
the
fossils
from
widely
separated
formations
.
Such
is
the
sum
of
the
several
chief
objections
and
difficulties
which
may
be
justly
urged
against
the
theory
;
and
I
have
now
briefly
recapitulated
the
answers
and
explanations
which
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
may
be
given
.
I
have
felt
these
difficulties
far
too
heavily
during
many
years
to
doubt
their
weight
.
But
it
deserves
especial
notice
that
the
more
important
objections
relate
to
questions
on
which
we
are
confessedly
ignorant
;
nor
do
we
know
how
ignorant
we
are
.
We
do
not
know
all
the
possible
transitional
gradations
between
the
simplest
and
the
most
perfect
organs
;
it
cannot
be
pretended
that
we
know
all
the
varied
means
of
Distribution
during
the
long
lapse
of
years
,
or
that
we
know
how
imperfect
is
the
Geological
Record
.
Serious
as
these
several
objections
are
,
in
my
judgment
they
are
by
no
means
sufficient
to
overthrow
the
theory
of
descent
with
subsequent
modification
.
Now
let
us
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
argument
.
Under
domestication
we
see
much
variability
,
caused
,
or
at
least
excited
,
by
changed
conditions
of
life
;
but
often
in
so
obscure
a
manner
,
that
we
are
tempted
to
consider
the
variations
as
spontaneous
.
Variability
is
governed
by
many
complex
laws
,
by
correlated
growth
,
compensation
,
the
increased
use
and
disuse
of
parts
,
and
the
definite
action
of
the
surrounding
conditions
.
There
is
much
difficulty
in
ascertaining
how
largely
our
domestic
productions
have
been
modified
;
but
we
may
safely
infer
that
the
amount
has
been
large
,
and
that
modifications
can
be
inherited
for
long
periods
.
As
long
as
the
conditions
of
life
remain
the
same
,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
modification
,
which
has
already
been
inherited
for
many
generations
,
may
continue
to
be
inherited
for
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
.
On
the
other
hand
,
we
have
evidence
that
variability
when
it
has
once
come
into
play
,
does
not
cease
under
domestication
for
a
very
long
period
;
nor
do
we
know
that
it
ever
ceases
,
for
new
varieties
are
still
occasionally
produced
by
our
oldest
domesticated
productions
.
Variability
is
not
actually
caused
by
man
;
he
only
unintentionally
exposes
organic
beings
to
new
conditions
of
life
,
and
then
nature
acts
on
the
organisation
and
causes
it
to
vary
.
But
man
can
and
does
select
the
variations
given
to
him
by
nature
,
and
thus
accumulates
them
in
any
desired
manner
.
He
thus
adapts
animals
and
plants
for
his
own
benefit
or
pleasure
.
He
may
do
this
methodically
,
or
he
may
do
it
unconsciously
by
preserving
the
individuals
most
useful
or
pleasing
to
him
without
any
intention
of
altering
the
breed
.
It
is
certain
that
he
can
largely
influence
the
character
of
a
breed
by
selecting
,
in
each
successive
generation
,
individual
differences
so
slight
as
to
be
inappreciable
except
by
an
educated
eye
.
This
unconscious
process
of
selection
has
been
the
great
agency
in
the
formation
of
the
most
distinct
and
useful
domestic
breeds
.
That
many
breeds
produced
by
man
have
to
a
large
extent
the
character
of
natural
species
,
is
shown
by
the
inextricable
doubts
whether
many
of
them
are
varieties
or
aboriginally
distinct
species
.
There
is
no
reason
why
the
principles
which
have
acted
so
efficiently
under
domestication
should
not
have
acted
under
nature
.
In
the
survival
of
favoured
individuals
and
races
,
during
the
constantly
recurrent
Struggle
for
Existence
,
we
see
a
powerful
and
ever
acting
form
of
Selection
.
The
struggle
for
existence
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
geometrical
ratio
of
increase
which
is
common
,
to
all
organic
beings
.
This
high
rate
of
increase
is
proved
by
calculation
,
by
the
rapid
increase
of
many
animals
and
plants
during
succession
of
peculiar
seasons
,
and
when
naturalised
in
new
countries
.
More
individuals
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
.
A
grain
in
the
balance
may
determine
which
individuals
shall
live
and
which
shall
die
,
which
variety
or
species
shall
increase
in
number
,
and
which
shall
decrease
,
or
finally
become
extinct
.
As
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
come
in
all
respects
into
the
closest
competition
with
each
other
,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
most
severe
between
them
;
it
will
be
almost
equally
severe
between
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
and
next
in
severity
between
the
species
of
the
same
genus
.
On
the
other
hand
the
struggle
will
often
be
severe
between
beings
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
.
The
slightest
advantage
in
certain
individuals
,
at
any
age
or
during
any
season
,
over
those
with
which
they
come
into
competition
,
or
better
adaptation
in
however
slight
a
degree
to
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
,
will
,
in
the
long
run
,
turn
the
balance
.
With
animals
having
separated
sexes
,
there
will
be
in
most
cases
a
struggle
between
the
males
for
the
possession
of
the
females
.
The
most
vigorous
males
,
or
those
which
have
most
successfully
struggled
with
their
conditions
of
life
,
will
generally
leave
most
progeny
.
But
success
will
often
depend
on
the
males
having
special
weapons
,
or
means
of
defence
,
or
charms
;
add
a
slight
advantage
will
lead
to
victory
.
As
geology
plainly
proclaims
that
each
land
has
undergone
great
physical
changes
,
we
might
have
expected
to
find
that
organic
beings
have
varied
under
nature
,
in
the
same
way
as
they
have
varied
under
domestication
.
And
if
there
has
been
any
variability
under
nature
,
it
would
be
an
unaccountable
fact
if
natural
selection
had
not
come
into
play
.
It
has
often
been
asserted
,
but
the
assertion
is
incapable
of
proof
,
that
the
amount
of
variation
under
nature
is
a
strictly
limited
quantity
.
Man
,
though
acting
on
external
characters
alone
and
often
capriciously
,
can
produce
within
a
short
period
a
great
result
by
adding
up
mere
individual
differences
in
his
domestic
productions
;
and
every
one
admits
that
species
present
individual
differences
.
But
,
besides
such
differences
,
all
naturalists
admit
that
natural
varieties
exist
,
which
are
considered
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
worthy
of
record
in
systematic
works
.
No
one
has
drawn
any
clear
distinction
between
individual
differences
and
slight
varieties
;
or
between
more
plainly
marked
varieties
and
sub
species
,
and
species
.
On
separate
continents
,
and
on
different
parts
of
the
same
continent
when
divided
by
barriers
of
any
kind
,
and
on
outlying
islands
,
what
a
multitude
of
forms
exist
,
which
some
experienced
naturalists
rank
as
varieties
,
others
as
geographical
races
or
sub
species
,
and
others
as
distinct
,
though
closely
allied
species!
If
,
then
,
animals
and
plants
do
vary
,
let
it
be
ever
so
slightly
or
slowly
,
why
should
not
variations
or
individual
differences
,
which
are
in
any
way
beneficial
,
be
preserved
and
accumulated
through
natural
selection
,
or
the
survival
of
the
fittest
?
If
man
can
by
patience
select
variations
useful
to
him
,
why
,
under
changing
and
complex
conditions
of
life
,
should
not
variations
useful
to
nature's
living
products
often
arise
,
and
be
preserved
or
selected
?
What
limit
can
be
put
to
this
power
,
acting
during
long
ages
and
rigidly
scrutinising
the
whole
constitution
,
structure
,
and
habits
of
each
creature
,
favouring
the
good
and
rejecting
the
bad
?
I
can
see
no
limit
to
this
power
,
in
slowly
and
beautifully
adapting
each
form
to
the
most
complex
relations
of
life
.
The
theory
of
natural
selection
,
even
if
we
look
no
farther
than
this
,
seems
to
be
in
the
highest
degree
probable
.
I
have
already
recapitulated
,
as
fairly
as
I
could
,
the
opposed
difficulties
and
objections
;
now
let
us
turn
to
the
special
facts
and
arguments
in
favour
of
the
theory
.
On
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
,
and
that
each
species
first
existed
as
a
variety
,
we
can
see
why
it
is
that
no
line
of
demarcation
can
be
drawn
between
species
,
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
produced
by
special
acts
of
creation
,
and
varieties
which
are
acknowledged
to
have
been
produced
by
secondary
laws
.
On
this
same
view
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
in
a
region
where
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
produced
,
and
where
they
now
flourish
,
these
same
species
should
present
many
varieties
;
for
where
the
manufactory
of
species
has
been
active
,
we
might
expect
,
as
a
general
rule
,
to
find
it
still
in
action
;
and
this
is
the
case
if
varieties
be
incipient
species
.
Moreover
,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
,
which
afford
the
greater
number
of
varieties
or
incipient
species
,
retain
to
a
certain
degree
the
character
of
varieties
;
for
they
differ
from
each
other
by
a
less
amount
of
difference
than
do
the
species
of
smaller
genera
.
The
closely
allied
species
also
of
the
larger
genera
apparently
have
restricted
ranges
,
and
in
their
affinities
they
are
clustered
in
little
groups
round
other
species
in
both
respects
resembling
varieties
.
These
are
strange
relations
on
the
view
that
each
species
was
independently
created
,
but
are
intelligible
if
each
existed
first
as
a
variety
.
As
each
species
tends
by
its
geometrical
rate
of
reproduction
to
increase
inordinately
in
number
;
and
as
the
modified
descendants
of
each
species
will
be
enabled
to
increase
by
as
much
as
they
become
more
diversified
in
habits
and
structure
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
seize
on
many
and
widely
different
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
there
will
be
a
constant
tendency
in
natural
selection
to
preserve
the
most
divergent
offspring
of
any
one
species
.
Hence
,
during
a
long
continued
course
of
modification
,
the
slight
differences
,
characteristic
of
varieties
of
the
same
species
,
tend
to
be
augmented
into
the
greater
differences
characteristic
of
the
species
of
the
same
genus
.
New
and
improved
varieties
will
inevitably
supplant
and
exterminate
the
older
,
less
improved
,
and
intermediate
varieties
;
and
thus
species
are
rendered
to
a
large
extent
defined
and
distinct
objects
.
Dominant
species
belonging
to
the
larger
groups
within
each
class
tend
to
give
birth
to
new
and
dominant
forms
;
so
that
each
large
group
tends
to
become
still
larger
,
and
at
the
same
time
more
divergent
in
character
.
But
as
all
groups
cannot
thus
go
on
increasing
in
size
,
for
the
world
would
not
hold
them
,
the
more
dominant
groups
beat
the
less
dominant
.
This
tendency
in
the
large
groups
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
and
diverging
in
character
,
together
with
the
inevitable
contingency
of
much
extinction
,
explains
the
arrangement
of
all
the
forms
of
life
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
,
all
within
a
few
great
classes
,
which
has
prevailed
throughout
all
time
.
This
grand
fact
of
the
grouping
of
all
organic
beings
under
what
is
called
the
Natural
System
,
is
utterly
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
.
As
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
accumulating
slight
,
successive
,
favourable
variations
,
it
can
produce
no
great
or
sudden
modifications
;
it
can
act
only
by
short
and
slow
steps
.
Hence
,
the
canon
of
"
Natura
non
facit
saltum
,
"
which
every
fresh
addition
to
our
knowledge
tends
to
confirm
,
is
on
this
theory
intelligible
.
We
can
see
why
throughout
nature
the
same
general
end
is
gained
by
an
almost
infinite
diversity
of
means
,
for
every
peculiarity
when
once
acquired
is
long
inherited
,
and
structures
already
modified
in
many
different
ways
have
to
be
adapted
for
the
same
general
purpose
.
We
can
,
in
short
,
see
why
nature
is
prodigal
in
variety
,
though
niggard
in
innovation
.
But
why
this
should
be
a
law
of
nature
if
each
species
has
been
independently
created
no
man
can
explain
.
Many
other
facts
are
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
explicable
on
this
theory
.
How
strange
it
is
that
a
bird
,
under
the
form
of
a
woodpecker
,
should
prey
on
insects
on
the
ground
;
that
upland
geese
which
rarely
or
never
swim
,
should
possess
webbed
feet
;
that
a
thrush
like
bird
should
dive
and
feed
on
sub
aquatic
insects
;
and
that
a
petrel
should
have
the
habits
and
structure
fitting
it
for
the
life
of
an
awk!
and
so
in
endless
other
cases
.
But
on
the
view
of
each
species
constantly
trying
to
increase
in
number
,
with
natural
selection
always
ready
to
adapt
the
slowly
varying
descendants
of
each
to
any
unoccupied
or
ill
occupied
place
in
nature
,
these
facts
cease
to
be
strange
,
or
might
even
have
been
anticipated
.
We
can
to
a
certain
extent
understand
how
it
is
that
there
is
so
much
beauty
throughout
nature
;
for
this
may
be
largely
attributed
to
the
agency
of
selection
.
That
beauty
,
according
to
our
sense
of
it
,
is
not
universal
,
must
be
admitted
by
every
one
who
will
look
at
some
venomous
snakes
,
at
some
fishes
,
and
at
certain
hideous
bats
with
a
distorted
resemblance
to
the
human
face
.
Sexual
selection
has
given
the
most
brilliant
colours
,
elegant
patterns
,
and
other
ornaments
to
the
males
,
and
sometimes
to
both
sexes
of
many
birds
,
butterflies
,
and
other
animals
.
With
birds
it
has
often
rendered
the
voice
of
the
male
musical
to
the
female
,
as
well
as
to
our
ears
.
Flowers
and
fruit
have
been
rendered
conspicuous
by
brilliant
colours
in
contrast
with
the
green
foliage
,
in
order
that
the
flowers
may
be
readily
seen
,
visited
and
fertilised
by
insects
,
and
the
seeds
disseminated
by
birds
.
How
it
comes
that
certain
colours
,
sounds
,
and
forms
should
give
pleasure
to
man
and
the
lower
animals
,
that
is
,
that
is
,
how
the
sense
of
beauty
in
its
simplest
form
was
first
acquired
,
we
do
not
know
any
more
than
how
certain
odours
and
flavours
were
first
rendered
agreeable
.
As
natural
selection
acts
by
competition
,
it
adapts
and
improves
the
inhabitants
of
each
country
only
in
relation
to
their
co
inhabitants
;
so
that
we
need
feel
no
surprise
at
the
species
of
any
one
country
,
although
on
the
ordinary
view
supposed
to
have
been
created
and
specially
adapted
for
that
country
,
being
beaten
and
supplanted
by
the
naturalised
productions
from
another
land
.
Nor
ought
we
to
marvel
if
all
the
contrivances
in
nature
be
not
,
as
far
.
as
we
can
judge
,
absolutely
perfect
,
as
in
the
case
even
of
the
human
eye
;
or
if
some
of
them
be
abhorrent
to
our
ideas
of
fitness
.
We
need
not
marvel
at
the
sting
of
the
bee
,
when
used
against
an
enemy
,
causing
the
bee's
own
death
;
at
drones
being
produced
in
such
great
numbers
for
one
single
act
,
and
being
then
slaughtered
by
their
sterile
sisters
;
at
the
astonishing
waste
of
pollen
by
our
fir
trees
;
at
the
instinctive
hatred
of
the
queen
bee
for
her
own
fertile
daughters
;
at
the
Ichneumonidae
feeding
within
the
living
bodies
of
caterpillars
;
or
at
other
such
cases
.
The
wonder
indeed
is
,
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
that
more
cases
of
the
want
of
absolute
perfection
have
not
been
detected
.
The
complex
and
little
known
laws
governing
the
production
of
varieties
are
the
same
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
with
the
laws
which
have
governed
the
production
of
distinct
species
.
In
both
cases
physical
conditions
seem
to
have
produced
some
direct
and
definite
effect
,
but
how
much
we
cannot
say
.
Thus
,
when
varieties
enter
any
new
station
,
they
occasionally
assume
some
of
the
characters
proper
to
the
species
of
that
station
.
With
both
varieties
and
species
,
use
and
disuse
seem
to
have
produced
a
considerable
effect
;
for
it
is
impossible
to
resist
this
conclusion
when
we
look
,
for
instance
,
at
the
logger
headed
duck
,
which
has
wings
incapable
of
flight
,
in
nearly
the
same
condition
as
in
the
domestic
duck
;
or
when
we
look
at
the
burrowing
tucu
tucu
,
which
is
occasionally
blind
,
and
then
at
certain
moles
,
which
are
habitually
blind
and
have
their
eyes
covered
with
skin
;
or
when
we
look
at
the
blind
animals
inhabiting
the
dark
caves
of
America
and
Europe
.
With
varieties
and
species
,
correlated
variation
seems
to
have
played
an
important
part
,
so
that
when
one
part
has
been
modified
other
parts
have
been
necessarily
modified
.
With
both
parties
and
.
species
,
reversions
to
long
lost
characters
occasionally
occur
.
How
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
is
the
occasional
appearance
of
stripes
on
the
shoulders
and
legs
of
the
several
species
of
the
horse
genus
and
of
their
hybrids!
How
simply
is
this
fact
explained
if
we
believe
that
these
species
are
all
descended
from
a
striped
progenitor
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
several
domestic
breeds
of
the
pigeon
are
descended
from
the
blue
and
barred
rock
pigeon!
On
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
,
why
should
specific
characters
,
or
those
by
which
the
species
of
the
same
genus
differ
from
each
other
,
be
more
variable
than
generic
characters
in
which
they
all
agree
?
Why
,
for
instance
,
should
the
colour
of
a
flower
be
more
likely
to
vary
in
any
one
species
of
a
genus
,
if
the
other
species
possess
differently
coloured
flowers
,
than
if
all
possessed
the
same
coloured
flowers
?
If
species
are
only
well
marked
varieties
,
of
which
the
characters
have
become
in
a
high
degree
permanent
,
we
can
understand
this
fact
;
for
they
have
already
varied
since
they
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
in
certain
characters
,
by
which
they
have
come
to
be
specifically
distinct
from
each
other
;
therefore
these
same
characters
would
be
more
likely
again
to
vary
than
the
generic
characters
which
have
been
inherited
without
change
for
an
immense
period
.
It
is
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
why
a
part
developed
in
a
very
unusual
manner
in
species
alone
of
a
genus
,
and
therefore
,
as
we
may
naturally
infer
,
of
great
importance
to
that
species
,
should
be
eminently
liable
to
variation
;
but
,
on
our
view
,
this
part
has
undergone
,
since
the
several
species
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
,
an
unusual
amount
of
variability
and
modification
,
and
therefore
we
might
expect
the
part
generally
to
be
still
variable
.
But
a
part
may
be
developed
in
the
most
unusual
manner
,
like
the
wing
of
a
bat
,
and
yet
not
be
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
,
if
the
part
be
common
to
many
subordinate
forms
,
that
is
,
if
it
has
been
inherited
for
a
very
long
period
;
for
in
this
case
,
it
will
have
been
rendered
constant
by
long
continued
natural
selection
.
Glancing
at
instincts
,
marvellous
as
some
are
,
they
offer
no
greater
difficulty
than
do
corporeal
structures
on
the
theory
of
the
natural
selection
of
successive
slight
,
but
profitable
modifications
.
We
can
thus
understand
why
nature
moves
by
graduated
steps
in
endowing
different
animals
of
the
same
class
with
their
several
instincts
.
I
have
attempted
to
show
how
much
light
the
principle
of
gradation
throws
on
the
admirable
architectural
powers
of
the
hive
bee
.
Habit
no
doubt
often
comes
into
play
in
modifying
instincts
;
but
it
certainly
is
not
indispensable
,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
neuter
insects
,
which
leave
no
progeny
to
inherit
the
effects
of
long
continued
habit
.
On
the
view
of
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
having
descended
from
a
common
parent
,
and
having
inherited
much
in
common
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
allied
species
,
when
placed
under
widely
different
conditions
of
life
,
yet
follow
nearly
the
same
instincts
;
why
the
thrushes
of
tropical
and
temperate
South
America
,
for
instance
,
line
their
nests
with
mud
like
our
British
species
.
On
the
view
of
instincts
having
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
,
we
need
not
marvel
at
some
instincts
being
not
perfect
and
liable
to
mistakes
,
and
at
many
instincts
causing
other
animals
to
suffer
.
If
species
be
only
well
marked
and
permanent
varieties
,
we
can
at
once
see
why
their
crossed
offspring
should
follow
the
same
complex
laws
in
their
degrees
and
kinds
of
resemblance
to
their
parents
,
in
being
absorbed
into
each
other
by
successive
crosses
,
and
in
other
such
points
,
as
do
the
crossed
offspring
of
acknowledged
varieties
.
This
similarity
would
be
a
strange
fact
,
if
species
had
been
independently
created
and
varieties
had
been
produced
through
secondary
laws
.
If
we
admit
that
the
geological
record
is
imperfect
to
an
extreme
degree
,
then
the
facts
,
which
the
record
does
give
,
strongly
support
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
.
New
species
have
come
on
the
stage
slowly
and
at
successive
intervals
;
and
the
amount
of
change
,
after
equal
intervals
of
time
,
is
widely
different
in
different
groups
.
The
extinction
of
species
and
of
whole
groups
of
species
which
has
played
so
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
history
of
the
organic
world
almost
inevitably
follows
from
the
principle
of
natural
selection
;
for
old
forms
are
supplanted
by
new
and
improved
forms
.
Neither
single
species
nor
groups
of
species
reappear
when
the
chain
of
ordinary
generation
is
once
broken
.
The
gradual
diffusion
of
dominant
forms
,
with
the
slow
modification
of
their
descendants
,
causes
the
forms
of
life
,
after
long
intervals
of
time
,
to
appear
as
if
they
had
changed
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
.
The
fact
of
the
fossil
remains
of
each
formation
being
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
the
fossils
in
the
formations
above
and
below
,
is
simply
explained
by
their
intermediate
position
in
the
chain
of
descent
.
The
grand
fact
that
all
extinct
beings
can
be
classed
with
all
recent
beings
,
naturally
follows
from
the
living
and
the
extinct
being
the
offspring
of
common
parents
.
As
species
have
generally
diverged
in
character
during
their
long
course
of
descent
and
modification
,
we
can
understand
why
it
is
that
the
more
ancient
forms
,
or
early
progenitors
of
each
group
,
so
often
occupy
a
position
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
existing
groups
.
Recent
forms
are
generally
looked
upon
as
being
,
on
the
whole
,
higher
in
the
scale
of
organisation
than
ancient
forms
;
and
they
must
be
higher
,
insofar
as
the
later
and
more
improved
forms
have
conquered
the
older
and
less
improved
forms
in
the
struggle
for
life
;
they
have
also
generally
had
their
organs
more
specialised
for
different
functions
.
This
fact
is
perfectly
compatible
with
numerous
beings
still
retaining
simple
and
but
little
improved
structures
,
fitted
for
simple
conditions
of
life
;
it
is
likewise
compatible
with
some
forms
having
retrograded
in
organisation
,
by
having
become
at
each
stage
of
descent
better
fitted
for
new
and
degraded
habits
of
life
.
Lastly
,
the
wonderful
law
of
the
long
endurance
of
allied
forms
on
the
same
continent
,
of
marsupials
in
Australia
,
of
Edentata
in
America
,
and
other
such
cases
,
is
intelligible
,
for
within
the
same
country
the
existing
and
the
extinct
will
be
closely
allied
by
descent
.
Looking
to
geographical
distribution
,
if
we
admit
that
there
has
been
during
the
long
course
of
ages
much
migration
from
one
part
of
the
world
to
another
,
owing
to
former
climatal
and
geographical
changes
and
to
the
many
occasional
and
unknown
means
of
dispersal
,
then
we
can
understand
,
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
,
most
of
the
great
leading
facts
in
Distribution
.
We
can
see
why
there
should
be
so
striking
a
parallelism
in
the
distribution
of
organic
beings
throughout
space
,
and
in
their
geological
succession
throughout
time
;
for
in
both
cases
the
beings
have
been
connected
by
the
bond
of
ordinary
generation
,
and
the
means
of
modification
have
been
the
same
.
We
see
the
full
meaning
of
the
wonderful
fact
,
which
has
struck
every
traveller
,
namely
,
that
on
the
same
continent
,
under
the
most
diverse
conditions
,
under
heat
and
cold
,
on
mountain
and
lowland
,
on
deserts
and
marshes
,
most
of
the
inhabitants
within
each
great
class
are
plainly
related
;
for
they
are
the
descendants
of
the
same
progenitors
and
early
colonists
.
On
this
same
principle
of
former
migration
,
combined
in
most
cases
with
modification
,
we
can
understand
,
by
the
aid
of
the
Glacial
period
,
the
identity
of
some
few
plants
,
and
the
close
alliance
of
many
others
,
on
the
most
distant
mountains
,
and
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
;
and
likewise
the
close
alliance
of
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
latitudes
,
though
separated
by
the
whole
intertropical
ocean
.
Although
two
countries
may
present
physical
conditions
as
closely
similar
as
the
same
species
ever
require
,
we
need
feel
no
surprise
at
their
inhabitants
being
widely
different
,
if
they
have
been
for
a
long
period
completely
sundered
from
each
other
;
for
as
the
relation
of
organism
to
organism
is
the
most
important
of
all
relations
,
and
as
the
two
countries
will
have
received
colonists
at
various
periods
and
in
different
proportions
,
from
some
other
country
or
from
each
other
,
the
course
of
modification
in
the
two
areas
will
inevitably
have
been
different
.
On
this
view
of
migration
,
with
subsequent
modification
,
we
see
why
oceanic
islands
are
inhabited
by
only
few
species
,
but
of
these
,
why
many
are
peculiar
or
endemic
forms
.
We
clearly
see
why
species
belonging
to
those
groups
of
animals
which
cannot
cross
wide
spaces
of
the
ocean
,
as
frogs
and
terrestrial
mammals
,
do
not
inhabit
oceanic
islands
;
and
why
,
on
the
other
hand
,
new
and
peculiar
species
of
bats
,
animals
which
can
traverse
the
ocean
,
are
found
on
islands
far
distant
from
any
continent
.
Such
cases
as
the
presence
of
peculiar
species
of
bats
on
oceanic
islands
and
the
absence
of
all
other
terrestrial
mammals
,
are
facts
utterly
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
independent
acts
of
creation
.
The
existence
of
closely
allied
or
representative
species
in
any
two
areas
,
implies
,
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
,
that
the
same
parent
forms
formerly
inhabited
both
areas
;
and
we
almost
invariably
find
that
wherever
many
closely
allied
species
inhabit
two
areas
,
some
identical
species
are
still
common
to
both
.
Wherever
many
closely
allied
yet
distinct
species
occur
,
doubtful
forms
and
varieties
belonging
to
the
same
groups
likewise
occur
.
It
is
a
rule
of
high
generality
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
area
are
related
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
nearest
source
whence
immigrants
might
have
been
derived
.
We
see
this
in
the
striking
relation
of
nearly
all
plants
and
animals
of
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
of
Juan
Fernandez
,
and
of
the
other
American
islands
,
to
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
neighbouring
American
mainland
;
and
of
those
of
the
Cape
de
Verde
Archipelago
,
and
of
the
other
African
islands
to
the
African
mainland
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
these
facts
receive
no
explanation
on
the
theory
of
creation
.
The
fact
,
as
we
have
seen
,
that
all
past
and
present
organic
beings
can
be
arranged
within
a
few
great
classes
,
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
,
and
with
the
extinct
groups
often
falling
in
between
the
recent
groups
,
is
intelligible
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
with
its
contingencies
of
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
.
On
these
same
principles
we
see
how
it
is
,
that
the
mutual
affinities
of
the
forms
within
each
class
are
so
complex
and
circuitous
.
We
see
why
certain
characters
are
far
more
serviceable
than
others
for
classification
;
why
adaptive
characters
,
though
of
paramount
importance
to
the
beings
,
are
of
hardly
any
importance
in
classification
;
why
characters
derived
from
rudimentary
parts
,
though
of
no
service
to
the
beings
,
are
often
of
high
classificatory
value
;
and
why
embryological
characters
are
often
the
most
valuable
of
all
.
The
real
affinities
of
all
organic
beings
,
in
contradistinction
to
their
adaptive
resemblances
,
are
due
to
inheritance
or
community
of
descent
.
The
Natural
System
is
a
genealogical
arrangement
,
with
the
acquired
grades
of
difference
,
marked
by
the
terms
,
varieties
,
species
,
genera
,
families
,
&c
.
;
and
we
have
to
discover
the
lines
of
descent
by
the
most
permanent
characters
whatever
they
may
be
and
of
however
slight
vital
importance
.
The
similar
framework
of
bones
in
the
hand
of
a
man
,
wing
of
a
bat
,
fin
of
the
porpoise
,
and
leg
of
the
horse
,
the
same
number
of
vertebrae
forming
the
neck
of
the
giraffe
and
of
the
elephant
,
and
innumerable
other
such
facts
,
at
once
explain
themselves
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
slow
and
slight
successive
modifications
.
The
similarity
of
pattern
in
the
wing
and
in
the
leg
of
a
bat
,
though
used
for
such
different
purpose
,
in
the
jaws
and
legs
of
a
crab
,
in
the
petals
,
stamens
,
and
pistils
of
a
flower
,
is
likewise
,
to
a
large
extent
,
intelligible
on
the
view
of
the
gradual
modification
of
parts
or
organs
,
which
were
aboriginally
alike
in
an
early
progenitor
in
each
of
these
classes
.
On
the
principle
of
successive
variations
not
always
supervening
at
an
early
age
,
and
being
inherited
at
a
corresponding
not
early
period
of
life
,
we
clearly
see
why
the
embryos
of
mammals
,
birds
,
reptiles
,
and
fishes
should
be
so
closely
similar
,
and
so
unlike
the
adult
forms
.
We
may
cease
marvelling
at
the
embryo
of
an
air
breathing
mammal
or
bird
having
branchial
slits
and
arteries
running
in
loops
,
like
those
of
a
fish
which
has
to
breathe
the
air
dissolved
in
water
by
the
aid
of
well
developed
branchiae
.
Disuse
,
aided
sometimes
by
natural
selection
,
will
often
have
reduced
organs
when
rendered
useless
under
changed
habits
or
conditions
of
life
;
and
we
can
understand
on
this
view
the
meaning
of
rudimentary
organs
.
But
disuse
and
selection
will
generally
act
on
each
creature
,
when
it
has
come
to
maturity
and
has
to
play
its
full
part
in
the
struggle
for
existence
,
and
will
thus
have
little
power
on
an
organ
during
early
life
;
hence
the
organ
will
not
be
reduced
or
rendered
rudimentary
at
this
early
age
.
The
calf
,
for
instance
,
has
inherited
teeth
,
which
never
cut
through
the
gums
of
the
upper
jaw
,
from
an
early
progenitor
having
well
developed
teeth
;
and
we
may
believe
,
that
the
teeth
in
the
mature
animal
were
formerly
reduced
by
disuse
,
owing
to
the
tongue
and
palate
,
or
lips
,
having
become
excellently
fitted
through
natural
selection
to
browse
without
their
aid
;
whereas
in
the
calf
,
the
teeth
have
been
left
unaffected
,
and
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
have
been
inherited
from
a
remote
period
to
the
present
day
.
On
the
view
of
each
organism
with
all
its
separate
parts
having
been
specially
created
,
how
utterly
inexplicable
is
it
that
organs
bearing
the
plain
stamp
of
inutility
,
such
as
the
teeth
in
the
embryonic
calf
or
the
shrivelled
wings
under
the
soldered
wingcovers
of
many
beetles
,
should
so
frequently
occur
.
Nature
may
be
said
to
have
taken
pains
to
reveal
her
scheme
of
modification
,
by
means
of
rudimentary
organs
,
of
embryological
and
homologous
structures
,
but
we
are
too
blind
to
understand
her
meaning
.
I
have
now
recapitulated
the
facts
and
considerations
which
have
thoroughly
convinced
me
that
species
have
been
modified
,
during
a
long
course
of
descent
.
This
has
been
effected
chiefly
through
the
natural
selection
of
numerous
successive
,
slight
,
favourable
variations
;
aided
in
an
important
manner
by
the
inherited
effects
of
the
use
and
disuse
of
parts
;
and
in
an
unimportant
manner
,
that
is
in
relation
to
adaptive
structures
,
whether
past
or
present
,
by
the
direct
action
of
external
conditions
,
and
by
variations
which
seem
to
us
in
our
ignorance
to
arise
spontaneously
.
It
appears
that
I
formerly
underrated
the
frequency
and
value
of
these
latter
forms
of
variation
,
as
leading
to
permanent
modifications
of
structure
independently
of
natural
selection
.
But
as
my
conclusions
have
lately
been
much
misrepresented
,
and
it
has
been
stated
that
I
attribute
the
modification
of
species
exclusively
to
natural
selection
,
I
may
be
permitted
to
remark
that
in
the
first
edition
of
this
work
,
and
subsequently
,
I
placed
in
a
most
conspicuous
position
namely
,
at
the
close
of
the
Introduction
the
following
words
:
"
I
am
convinced
that
natural
selection
has
been
the
main
but
not
the
exclusive
means
of
modification
.
"
This
has
been
of
no
avail
.
Great
is
the
power
of
steady
misrepresentation
;
but
the
history
of
science
shows
that
fortunately
this
power
does
not
long
endure
.
It
can
hardly
be
supposed
that
a
false
theory
would
explain
,
in
so
satisfactory
a
manner
as
does
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
the
several
large
classes
of
facts
above
specified
.
It
has
recently
been
objected
that
this
is
an
unsafe
method
of
arguing
;
but
it
is
a
method
used
in
judging
of
the
common
events
of
life
,
and
has
often
been
used
by
the
greatest
natural
philosophers
.
The
undulatory
theory
of
light
has
thus
been
arrived
at
;
and
the
belief
in
the
revolution
of
the
earth
on
its
own
axis
was
until
lately
supported
by
hardly
any
direct
evidence
.
It
is
no
valid
objection
that
science
as
yet
throws
no
light
on
the
far
higher
problem
of
the
essence
or
origin
of
life
.
Who
can
explain
what
is
the
essence
of
the
attraction
of
gravity
?
No
one
now
objects
to
following
out
the
results
consequent
on
this
unknown
element
of
attraction
;
notwithstanding
that
Leibnitz
formerly
accused
Newton
of
introducing
"
occult
qualities
and
miracles
into
philosophy
.
"
I
see
no
good
reason
why
the
views
given
in
this
volume
should
shock
the
religious
feelings
of
any
one
.
It
is
satisfactory
,
as
showing
how
transient
such
impressions
are
,
to
remember
that
the
greatest
discovery
ever
made
by
man
,
namely
,
the
law
of
the
attraction
of
gravity
,
was
also
attacked
by
Leibnitz
,
"
as
subversive
of
natural
,
and
inferentially
of
revealed
,
religion
.
"
A
celebrated
author
and
divine
has
written
to
me
that
"
he
has
gradually
learnt
to
see
that
it
is
just
as
noble
a
conception
of
the
Deity
to
believe
that
He
created
a
few
original
forms
capable
of
self
development
into
other
and
needful
forms
,
as
to
believe
that
He
required
a
fresh
act
of
creation
to
supply
the
voids
caused
by
the
action
of
His
laws
.
"
Why
,
it
may
be
asked
,
until
recently
did
nearly
all
the
most
eminent
living
naturalists
and
geologists
disbelieve
in
the
mutability
of
species
?
It
cannot
be
asserted
that
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
are
subject
to
no
variation
;
it
cannot
be
proved
that
the
amount
of
variation
in
the
course
of
long
ages
is
a
limited
quality
;
no
clear
distinction
has
been
,
or
can
be
,
drawn
between
species
and
well
marked
varieties
.
It
cannot
be
maintained
that
species
when
intercrossed
are
invariably
sterile
,
and
varieties
invariably
fertile
;
or
that
sterility
is
a
special
endowment
and
sign
of
creation
.
The
belief
that
species
were
immutable
productions
was
almost
unavoidable
as
long
as
the
history
of
the
world
was
thought
to
be
of
short
duration
;
and
now
that
we
have
acquired
some
idea
of
the
lapse
of
time
,
we
are
too
apt
to
assume
,
without
proof
,
that
the
geological
record
is
so
perfect
that
it
would
have
afforded
us
plain
evidence
of
the
mutation
of
species
,
if
they
had
undergone
mutation
.
But
the
chief
cause
of
our
natural
unwillingness
to
admit
that
one
species
has
given
birth
to
clear
and
distinct
species
,
is
that
we
are
always
slow
in
admitting
great
changes
of
which
we
do
not
see
the
steps
.
The
difficulty
is
the
same
as
that
felt
by
so
many
geologists
,
when
Lyell
first
insisted
that
long
lines
of
inland
cliffs
had
been
formed
,
and
great
valleys
excavated
,
by
the
agencies
which
we
see
still
at
work
.
The
mind
cannot
possibly
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
of
even
a
million
years
;
it
cannot
add
up
and
perceive
the
full
effects
of
many
slight
variations
,
accumulated
during
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
.
Although
I
am
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
views
given
in
this
volume
under
the
form
of
an
abstract
,
I
by
no
means
expect
to
convince
experienced
naturalists
whose
minds
are
stocked
with
a
multitude
of
facts
all
viewed
,
during
a
long
course
of
years
,
from
a
point
of
view
directly
opposite
to
mine
.
It
is
so
easy
to
hide
our
ignorance
under
such
expressions
as
the
"
plan
of
creation
"
or
"
unity
of
design
,
"
&c
.
,
and
to
think
that
we
give
an
explanation
when
we
only
restate
a
fact
.
Any
one
whose
disposition
leads
him
to
attach
more
weight
to
unexplained
difficulties
than
to
the
explanation
of
a
certain
number
of
facts
will
certainly
reject
the
theory
.
A
few
naturalists
,
endowed
with
much
flexibility
of
mind
,
and
who
have
already
begun
to
doubt
the
immutability
of
species
,
may
be
influenced
by
this
volume
;
but
I
look
with
confidence
to
the
future
,
to
young
and
rising
naturalists
,
who
will
be
able
to
view
both
sides
of
the
question
with
impartiality
.
Whoever
is
led
to
believe
that
species
are
mutable
will
do
good
service
by
conscientiously
expressing
his
conviction
;
for
thus
only
can
the
load
of
prejudice
by
which
this
subject
is
overwhelmed
be
removed
.
Several
eminent
naturalists
have
of
late
published
their
belief
that
a
multitude
of
reputed
species
in
each
genus
are
not
real
species
;
but
that
other
species
are
real
,
that
is
,
have
been
independently
created
.
This
seems
to
me
a
strange
conclusion
to
arrive
at
.
They
admit
that
a
multitude
of
forms
,
which
till
lately
they
themselves
thought
were
special
creations
,
and
which
are
still
thus
looked
at
by
the
majority
of
naturalists
,
and
which
consequently
have
all
the
external
characteristic
features
of
true
species
,
they
admit
that
these
have
been
produced
by
variation
,
but
they
refuse
to
extend
the
same
view
to
other
and
slightly
different
forms
.
Nevertheless
they
do
not
pretend
that
they
can
define
,
or
even
conjecture
,
which
are
the
created
forms
of
life
,
and
which
are
those
produced
by
secondary
laws
.
They
admit
variation
as
a
vera
causa
in
one
case
,
they
arbitrarily
reject
it
in
another
,
without
assigning
any
distinction
in
the
two
cases
.
The
day
will
come
when
this
will
be
given
as
a
curious
illustration
of
the
blindness
of
preconceived
opinion
.
These
authors
seem
no
more
startled
at
a
miraculous
act
of
creation
than
at
an
ordinary
birth
.
But
do
they
really
believe
that
at
innumerable
periods
in
the
earth's
history
certain
elemental
atoms
have
been
commanded
suddenly
to
flash
into
living
tissues
?
Do
they
believe
that
at
each
supposed
act
of
creation
one
individual
or
many
were
produced
?
Were
all
the
infinitely
numerous
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
created
as
eggs
or
seed
,
or
as
full
grown
?
and
in
the
case
of
mammals
,
were
they
created
bearing
the
false
marks
of
nourishment
from
the
mother's
womb
?
Undoubtedly
some
of
these
same
questions
cannot
be
answered
by
those
who
believe
in
the
appearance
or
creation
of
only
a
few
forms
of
life
,
or
of
some
one
form
alone
.
It
has
been
maintained
by
several
authors
that
it
is
as
easy
to
believe
in
the
creation
of
a
million
beings
as
of
one
;
but
Maupertuis'
philosophical
axiom
"
of
least
action
"
leads
the
mind
more
willingly
to
admit
the
smaller
number
;
and
certainly
we
ought
not
to
believe
that
innumerable
beings
within
each
great
class
have
been
created
with
plain
,
but
deceptive
,
marks
of
descent
from
a
single
parent
.
As
a
record
of
a
former
state
of
things
,
I
have
retained
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs
,
and
elsewhere
,
several
sentences
which
imply
that
naturalists
believe
in
the
separate
creation
of
each
species
;
and
I
have
been
much
censured
for
having
thus
expressed
myself
.
But
undoubtedly
this
was
the
general
belief
when
the
first
edition
of
the
present
work
appeared
.
I
formerly
spoke
to
very
many
naturalists
on
the
subject
of
evolution
,
and
never
once
met
with
any
sympathetic
agreement
.
It
is
probable
that
some
did
then
believe
in
evolution
,
but
they
were
either
silent
,
or
expressed
themselves
so
ambiguously
that
it
was
not
easy
to
understand
their
meaning
.
Now
things
are
wholly
changed
,
and
almost
every
naturalist
admits
the
great
principle
of
evolution
.
There
are
,
however
,
some
who
still
think
that
species
have
suddenly
given
birth
,
through
quite
unexplained
means
,
to
new
and
totally
different
forms
:
but
,
as
I
have
attempted
to
show
,
weighty
evidence
can
be
opposed
to
the
admission
of
great
and
abrupt
modifications
.
Under
a
scientific
point
of
view
,
and
as
leading
to
further
investigation
,
but
little
advantage
is
gained
by
believing
that
new
forms
are
suddenly
developed
in
an
inexplicable
manner
from
old
and
widely
different
forms
,
over
the
old
belief
in
the
creation
of
species
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
.
It
may
be
asked
how
far
I
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
modification
of
species
.
The
question
is
difficult
to
answer
,
because
the
more
distinct
the
forms
are
which
we
consider
,
by
so
much
the
arguments
in
favour
of
community
of
descent
become
fewer
in
number
and
less
in
force
.
But
some
arguments
of
the
greatest
weight
extend
very
far
.
All
the
members
of
whole
classes
are
connected
together
by
a
chain
of
affinities
,
and
all
can
be
classed
on
the
same
principle
,
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
.
Fossil
remains
sometimes
tend
to
fill
up
very
wide
intervals
between
existing
orders
.
Organs
in
a
rudimentary
condition
plainly
show
that
an
early
progenitor
had
the
organ
in
a
fully
developed
condition
;
and
this
in
some
cases
implies
an
enormous
amount
of
modification
in
the
descendants
.
Throughout
whole
classes
various
structures
are
formed
on
the
same
pattern
,
and
at
a
very
early
age
the
embryos
closely
resemble
each
other
.
Therefore
I
cannot
doubt
that
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
embraces
all
the
members
of
the
same
great
class
or
kingdom
.
I
believe
that
animals
are
descended
from
at
most
only
four
or
five
progenitors
,
and
plants
from
an
equal
or
lesser
number
.
Analogy
would
lead
me
one
step
farther
,
namely
,
to
the
belief
that
all
animals
and
plants
are
descended
from
some
one
prototype
.
But
analogy
may
be
a
deceitful
guide
.
Nevertheless
all
living
things
have
much
in
common
,
in
their
chemical
composition
,
their
cellular
structure
,
their
laws
of
growth
,
and
their
liability
to
injurious
influences
.
We
see
this
even
in
so
trifling
a
fact
as
that
the
same
poison
often
similarly
affects
plants
and
animals
;
or
that
the
poison
secreted
by
the
gallfly
produces
monstrous
growths
on
the
wild
rose
or
oak
tree
.
With
all
organic
beings
excepting
perhaps
some
of
the
very
lowest
,
sexual
production
seems
to
be
essentially
similar
.
With
all
,
as
far
as
is
at
present
known
the
germinal
vesicle
is
the
same
;
so
that
all
organisms
start
from
a
common
origin
.
If
we
look
even
to
the
two
main
divisions
namely
,
to
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
certain
low
forms
are
so
far
intermediate
in
character
that
naturalists
have
disputed
to
which
kingdom
they
should
be
referred
.
As
Professor
Asa
Gray
has
remarked
,
"
The
spores
and
other
reproductive
bodies
of
many
of
the
lower
algae
may
claim
to
have
first
a
characteristically
animal
,
and
then
an
unequivocally
vegetable
existence
.
"
Therefore
,
on
the
principle
of
natural
selection
with
divergence
of
character
,
it
does
not
seem
incredible
that
,
from
such
low
and
intermediate
form
,
both
animals
and
plants
may
have
been
developed
;
and
,
if
we
admit
this
,
we
must
likewise
admit
that
all
the
organic
beings
which
have
ever
lived
on
this
earth
may
be
descended
from
some
one
primordial
form
.
But
this
inference
is
chiefly
grounded
on
analogy
and
it
is
immaterial
whether
or
not
it
be
accepted
.
No
doubt
it
is
possible
,
as
Mr
.
G
.
H
.
Lewes
has
urged
,
that
at
the
first
commencement
of
life
many
different
forms
were
evolved
;
but
if
so
we
may
conclude
that
only
a
very
few
have
left
modified
descendants
.
For
,
as
I
have
recently
remarked
in
regard
to
the
members
of
each
great
kingdom
,
such
as
the
Vertebrata
,
Articulata
,
&c
.
,
we
have
distinct
evidence
in
their
embryological
homologous
and
rudimentary
structures
that
within
each
kingdom
all
the
members
are
descended
from
a
single
progenitor
.
When
the
views
advanced
by
me
in
this
volume
,
and
by
Mr
.
Wallace
,
or
when
analogous
views
on
the
origin
of
species
are
generally
admitted
,
we
can
dimly
foresee
that
there
will
be
a
considerable
revolution
in
natural
history
.
Systematists
will
be
able
to
pursue
their
labours
as
at
present
;
but
they
will
not
be
incessantly
haunted
by
the
shadowy
doubt
whether
this
or
that
form
be
a
true
species
.
This
,
I
feel
sure
and
I
speak
after
experience
,
will
be
no
slight
relief
.
The
endless
disputes
whether
or
not
some
fifty
species
of
British
brambles
are
good
species
will
cease
.
Systematists
will
have
only
to
decide
(
not
that
this
will
be
easy
)
whether
any
form
be
sufficiently
constant
and
distinct
from
other
forms
,
to
be
capable
of
definition
;
and
if
definable
,
whether
the
differences
be
sufficiently
important
to
deserve
a
specific
name
.
This
latter
point
will
become
a
far
more
essential
consideration
than
it
is
at
present
;
for
differences
,
however
slight
,
between
any
two
forms
if
not
blended
by
intermediate
gradations
,
are
looked
at
by
most
naturalists
as
sufficient
to
raise
both
forms
to
the
rank
of
species
.
Hereafter
we
shall
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
only
distinction
between
species
and
well
marked
varieties
is
,
that
the
latter
are
known
,
or
believed
,
to
be
connected
at
the
present
day
by
intermediate
gradations
,
whereas
species
were
formerly
thus
connected
.
Hence
,
without
rejecting
the
consideration
of
the
present
existence
of
intermediate
gradations
between
any
two
forms
we
shall
be
led
to
weigh
more
carefully
and
to
value
higher
the
actual
amount
of
difference
between
them
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
forms
now
generally
acknowledged
to
be
merely
varieties
may
hereafter
be
thought
worthy
of
specific
names
;
and
in
this
case
scientific
and
common
language
will
come
into
accordance
.
In
short
,
we
shall
have
to
treat
species
in
the
same
manner
as
those
naturalists
treat
genera
,
who
admit
that
genera
are
merely
artificial
combinations
made
for
convenience
.
This
may
not
be
a
cheering
prospect
;
but
we
shall
at
least
be
free
from
the
vain
search
for
the
undiscovered
and
undiscoverable
essence
of
the
term
species
.
The
other
and
more
general
departments
of
natural
history
will
rise
greatly
in
interest
.
The
terms
used
by
naturalists
,
of
affinity
,
relationship
,
community
of
type
,
paternity
,
morphology
,
adaptive
characters
,
rudimentary
and
aborted
organs
,
&c
.
,
will
cease
to
be
metaphorical
,
and
will
have
a
plain
signification
.
When
we
no
longer
look
at
an
organic
being
as
a
savage
looks
at
a
ship
,
as
something
wholly
beyond
his
comprehension
;
when
we
regard
every
production
of
nature
as
one
which
has
had
a
long
history
;
when
we
contemplate
every
complex
structure
and
instinct
as
the
summing
up
of
many
contrivances
,
each
useful
to
the
possessor
,
in
the
same
way
as
any
great
mechanical
invention
is
the
summing
up
of
the
labour
,
the
experience
,
the
reason
,
and
even
the
blunders
of
numerous
workmen
;
when
we
thus
view
each
organic
being
,
how
far
more
interesting
I
speak
from
experience
does
the
study
of
natural
history
become!
A
grand
and
almost
untrodden
field
of
inquiry
will
be
opened
,
on
the
causes
and
laws
of
variation
,
on
correlation
,
on
the
effects
of
use
and
disuse
,
on
the
direct
action
of
external
conditions
,
and
so
forth
.
The
study
of
domestic
productions
will
rise
immensely
in
value
.
A
new
variety
raised
by
man
will
be
a
more
important
and
interesting
subject
for
study
than
one
more
species
added
to
the
infinitude
of
already
recorded
species
.
Our
classifications
will
come
to
be
,
as
far
as
they
can
be
so
made
,
genealogies
;
and
will
then
truly
give
what
may
be
called
the
plan
of
creation
.
The
rules
for
classifying
will
no
doubt
become
simpler
when
we
have
a
definite
object
in
view
.
We
possess
no
pedigrees
or
armorial
bearings
;
and
we
have
to
discover
and
trace
the
many
diverging
lines
of
descent
in
our
natural
genealogies
,
by
characters
of
any
kind
which
have
long
been
inherited
.
Rudimentary
organs
will
speak
infallibly
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
long
lost
structures
.
Species
and
groups
of
species
which
are
called
aberrant
,
and
which
may
fancifully
be
called
living
fossils
,
will
aid
us
in
forming
a
picture
of
the
ancient
forms
of
life
.
Embryology
will
often
reveal
to
us
the
structure
,
in
some
degree
obscured
,
of
the
prototype
of
each
great
class
.
When
we
feel
assured
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
all
the
closely
allied
species
of
most
genera
,
have
within
a
not
very
remote
period
descended
from
one
parent
,
and
have
migrated
from
some
one
birth
place
;
and
when
we
better
know
the
many
means
of
migration
,
then
,
by
the
light
which
geology
now
throws
,
and
will
continue
to
throw
,
on
former
changes
of
climate
and
of
the
level
of
the
land
,
we
shall
surely
be
enabled
to
trace
in
an
admirable
manner
the
former
migrations
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
whole
world
.
Even
at
present
,
by
comparing
the
differences
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
on
the
opposite
sides
of
a
continent
,
and
the
nature
of
the
various
inhabitants
on
that
continent
,
in
relation
to
their
apparent
means
of
immigration
,
some
light
can
be
thrown
on
ancient
geography
.
The
noble
science
of
Geology
loses
glory
from
the
extreme
imperfection
of
the
record
.
The
crust
of
the
earth
with
its
imbedded
remains
must
not
be
looked
at
as
a
well
filled
museum
,
but
as
a
poor
collection
made
at
hazard
and
at
rare
intervals
.
The
accumulation
of
each
great
fossiliferous
formation
will
be
recognised
as
having
depended
on
an
unusual
concurrence
of
favourable
circumstances
,
and
the
blank
intervals
between
the
successive
stages
as
having
been
of
vast
duration
.
But
we
shall
be
able
to
gauge
with
some
security
the
duration
of
these
intervals
by
a
comparison
of
the
preceding
and
succeeding
organic
forms
.
We
must
be
cautious
in
attempting
to
correlate
as
strictly
contemporaneous
two
formations
,
which
do
not
include
many
identical
species
,
by
the
general
succession
of
the
forms
of
life
.
As
species
are
produced
and
exterminated
by
slowly
acting
and
still
existing
causes
,
and
not
by
miraculous
acts
of
creation
;
and
as
the
most
important
of
all
causes
of
organic
change
is
one
which
is
almost
independent
of
altered
and
perhaps
suddenly
altered
physical
conditions
,
namely
,
the
mutual
relation
of
organism
to
organism
,
the
improvement
of
one
organism
entailing
the
improvement
or
the
extermination
of
others
;
it
follows
,
that
the
amount
of
organic
change
in
the
fossils
of
consecutive
formations
probably
serves
as
a
fair
measure
of
the
relative
though
not
actual
lapse
of
time
.
A
number
of
species
,
however
,
keeping
in
a
body
might
remain
for
a
long
period
unchanged
,
whilst
within
the
same
period
several
of
these
species
by
migrating
into
new
countries
and
coming
into
competition
with
foreign
associates
,
might
become
modified
;
so
that
we
must
not
overrate
the
accuracy
of
organic
change
as
a
measure
of
time
.
In
the
future
I
see
open
fields
for
far
more
important
researches
.
Psychology
will
be
securely
based
on
the
foundation
already
well
laid
by
Mr
.
Herbert
Spencer
,
that
of
the
necessary
acquirement
of
each
mental
power
and
capacity
by
gradation
.
Much
light
will
be
thrown
on
the
origin
of
man
and
his
history
.
Authors
of
the
highest
eminence
seem
to
be
fully
satisfied
with
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
.
To
my
mind
it
accords
better
with
what
we
know
of
the
laws
impressed
on
matter
by
the
Creator
,
that
the
production
and
extinction
of
the
past
and
present
inhabitants
of
the
world
should
have
been
due
to
secondary
causes
,
like
those
determining
the
birth
and
death
of
the
individual
.
When
I
view
all
beings
not
as
special
creations
,
but
as
the
lineal
descendants
of
some
few
beings
which
lived
long
before
the
first
bed
of
the
Cambrian
system
was
deposited
,
they
seem
to
me
to
become
ennobled
.
Judging
from
the
past
,
we
may
safely
infer
that
not
one
living
species
will
transmit
its
unaltered
likeness
to
a
distant
futurity
.
And
of
the
species
now
living
very
few
will
transmit
progeny
of
any
kind
to
a
far
distant
futurity
;
for
the
manner
in
which
all
organic
beings
are
grouped
,
shows
that
the
greater
number
of
species
in
each
genus
,
and
all
the
species
in
many
genera
,
have
left
no
descendants
,
but
have
become
utterly
extinct
.
We
can
so
far
take
a
prophetic
glance
into
futurity
as
to
foretell
that
it
will
be
the
common
and
widely
spread
species
,
belonging
to
the
larger
and
dominant
groups
within
each
class
,
which
will
ultimately
prevail
and
procreate
new
and
dominant
species
.
As
all
the
living
forms
of
life
are
the
lineal
descendants
of
those
which
lived
long
before
the
Cambrian
epoch
,
we
may
feel
certain
that
the
ordinary
succession
by
generation
has
never
once
been
broken
,
and
that
no
cataclysm
has
desolated
the
whole
world
.
Hence
we
may
look
with
some
confidence
to
secure
future
of
great
length
.
And
as
natural
selection
works
solely
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
,
all
corporeal
and
mental
endowments
will
tend
to
progress
towards
perfection
.
It
is
interesting
to
contemplate
a
tangled
bank
,
clothed
with
many
plants
of
many
kinds
,
with
birds
singing
on
the
bushes
,
with
various
insects
flitting
about
,
and
with
worms
crawling
through
the
damp
earth
,
and
to
reflect
that
these
elaborately
constructed
forms
,
so
different
from
each
other
,
and
dependent
upon
each
other
in
so
complex
a
manner
,
have
all
been
produced
by
laws
acting
around
us
.
These
laws
,
taken
in
the
largest
sense
,
being
Growth
with
Reproduction
;
Inheritance
which
is
almost
implied
by
reproduction
;
Variability
from
the
indirect
and
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
and
from
use
and
disuse
:
a
Ratio
of
Increase
so
high
as
to
lead
to
a
Struggle
for
Life
,
and
as
a
consequence
to
Natural
Selection
,
entailing
Divergence
of
Character
and
the
Extinction
of
less
improved
forms
.
Thus
,
from
the
war
of
nature
,
from
famine
and
death
,
the
most
exalted
object
which
we
are
capable
of
conceiving
,
namely
,
the
production
of
the
higher
animals
,
directly
follows
.
There
is
grandeur
in
this
view
of
life
,
with
its
several
powers
,
having
been
originally
breathed
by
the
Creator
into
a
few
forms
or
into
one
;
and
that
,
whilst
this
planet
has
gone
cycling
on
according
to
the
fixed
law
of
gravity
,
from
so
simple
a
beginning
endless
forms
most
beautiful
and
most
wonderful
have
been
,
and
are
being
evolved
.

ZOEA
STAGE
,
The
earliest
stage
in
the
development
of
many
of
the
higher
Crustacea
,
so
called
from
the
name
of
Zoea
applied
to
these
young
animals
when
they
were
supposed
to
constitute
a
peculiar
genus
.
ZOOIDS
,
In
many
of
the
lower
animals
(
such
as
the
corals
,
Medusae
,
&c
.
)
reproduction
takes
place
in
two
ways
,
namely
,
by
means
of
eggs
and
by
a
process
of
budding
with
or
without
separation
from
the
parent
of
the
product
of
the
latter
,
which
is
often
very
different
from
that
of
the
egg
.
The
individuality
of
the
species
is
represented
by
the
whole
of
the
form
produced
between
two
sexual
reproductions
;
and
these
forms
,
which
are
apparently
individual
animals
,
have
been
called
zooide
