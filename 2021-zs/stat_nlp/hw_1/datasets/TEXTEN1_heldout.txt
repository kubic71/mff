transport
,
the
belief
that
a
single
birthplace
is
the
law
,
seems
to
me
incomparably
the
safest
.
In
discussing
this
subject
,
we
shall
be
enabled
at
the
same
time
to
consider
a
point
equally
important
for
us
,
namely
,
whether
the
several
species
of
a
genus
which
must
on
our
theory
all
be
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
,
can
have
migrated
,
undergoing
modification
during
their
migration
,
from
some
one
area
.
If
,
when
most
of
the
species
inhabiting
one
region
are
different
from
those
of
another
region
,
though
closely
allied
to
them
,
it
can
be
shown
that
migration
from
the
one
region
to
the
other
has
probably
occurred
at
some
former
period
,
our
general
view
will
be
much
strengthened
;
for
the
explanation
is
obvious
on
the
principle
of
descent
with
modification
.
A
volcanic
island
,
for
instance
,
upheaved
and
formed
at
the
distance
of
a
few
hundreds
of
miles
from
a
continent
,
would
probably
receive
from
it
in
the
course
of
time
a
few
colonists
,
and
their
descendants
,
though
modified
,
would
still
be
related
by
inheritance
to
the
inhabitants
of
that
continent
.
Cases
of
this
nature
are
common
,
and
are
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
independent
creation
.
This
view
of
the
relation
of
the
species
of
one
region
to
those
of
another
,
does
not
differ
much
from
that
advanced
by
Mr
.
Wallace
,
who
concludes
that
"
every
species
has
come
into
existence
coincident
both
in
space
and
time
with
a
pre
existing
closely
allied
species
.
"
And
it
is
now
well
known
that
he
attributes
this
coincidence
to
descent
with
modification
.
The
question
of
single
or
multiple
centres
of
creation
differs
from
another
though
allied
question
,
namely
,
whether
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
descended
from
a
single
pair
,
or
single
hermaphrodite
,
or
whether
,
as
some
authors
suppose
,
from
many
individuals
simultaneously
created
.
With
organic
beings
which
never
intercross
,
if
such
exist
,
each
species
must
be
descended
from
a
succession
of
modified
varieties
,
that
have
supplanted
each
other
,
but
have
never
blended
with
other
individuals
or
varieties
of
the
same
species
;
so
that
,
at
each
successive
stage
of
modification
,
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
form
will
be
descended
from
a
single
parent
.
But
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
,
namely
,
with
all
organisms
which
habitually
unite
for
each
birth
,
or
which
occasionally
intercross
,
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
inhabiting
the
same
area
will
be
kept
nearly
uniform
by
intercrossing
;
so
that
many
individuals
will
go
on
simultaneously
changing
,
and
the
whole
amount
of
modification
at
each
stage
will
not
be
due
to
descent
from
a
single
parent
.
To
illustrate
what
I
mean
:
our
English
race
horses
differ
from
the
horses
of
every
other
breed
;
but
they
do
not
owe
their
difference
and
superiority
to
descent
from
any
single
pair
,
but
to
continued
care
in
the
selecting
and
training
of
many
individuals
during
each
generation
.
Before
discussing
the
three
classes
of
facts
,
which
I
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest
amount
of
difficulty
on
the
theory
of
"
single
centres
of
creation
,
"
I
must
say
a
few
words
on
the
means
of
dispersal
.
Means
of
Dispersal
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
other
authors
have
ably
treated
this
subject
.
I
can
give
here
only
the
briefest
abstract
of
the
more
important
facts
.
Change
of
climate
must
have
had
a
powerful
influence
on
migration
.
A
region
now
impassable
to
certain
organisms
from
the
nature
of
its
climate
,
might
have
been
a
high
road
for
migration
,
when
the
climate
was
different
.
I
shall
,
however
,
presently
have
to
discuss
this
branch
of
the
subject
in
some
detail
.
Changes
of
level
in
the
land
must
also
have
been
highly
influential
:
a
narrow
isthmus
now
separates
two
marine
faunas
;
submerge
it
,
or
let
it
formerly
have
been
submerged
,
and
the
two
faunas
will
now
blend
together
,
or
may
formerly
have
blended
.
Where
the
sea
now
extends
,
land
may
at
a
former
period
have
connected
islands
or
possibly
even
continents
together
,
and
thus
have
allowed
terrestrial
productions
to
pass
from
one
to
the
other
No
geologist
disputes
that
great
mutations
of
level
have
occurred
within
the
period
of
existing
organisms
.
Edward
Forbes
insisted
that
all
the
islands
in
the
Atlantic
must
have
been
recently
connected
with
Europe
or
Africa
,
and
Europe
likewise
with
America
.
Other
authors
have
thus
hypothetically
bridged
over
every
ocean
,
and
united
almost
every
island
with
some
mainland
.
If
indeed
the
arguments
used
by
Forbes
are
to
be
trusted
,
it
must
be
admitted
that
scarcely
a
single
island
exists
which
has
not
recently
been
united
to
some
continent
.
This
view
cuts
the
Gordian
knot
of
the
dispersal
of
the
same
species
to
the
more
distant
points
,
and
removes
many
a
difficulty
;
but
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
we
are
not
authorised
in
admitting
such
enormous
geographical
changes
within
the
period
of
existing
species
.
It
seems
to
me
that
we
have
abundant
evidence
of
great
oscillations
in
the
level
of
the
land
or
sea
;
but
not
of
such
vast
change
in
the
position
and
extension
of
our
continents
,
as
to
have
united
them
within
the
recent
period
to
each
other
and
to
the
several
intervening
oceanic
islands
.
I
freely
admit
the
former
existence
of
many
islands
,
now
buried
beneath
the
sea
,
which
may
have
served
as
halting
places
for
plants
and
for
many
animals
during
their
migration
.
In
the
coral
producing
oceans
such
sunken
islands
are
now
marked
by
rings
of
coral
or
atolls
standing
over
them
.
Whenever
it
is
fully
admitted
,
as
it
will
some
day
be
,
that
each
species
has
proceeded
from
a
single
birthplace
,
and
when
in
the
course
of
time
we
know
something
definite
about
the
means
of
distribution
,
we
shall
be
enabled
to
speculate
with
security
on
the
former
extension
of
the
land
.
But
I
do
not
believe
that
it
will
ever
be
proved
that
within
the
recent
period
most
of
our
continents
which
now
stand
quite
separate
have
been
continuously
,
or
almost
continuously
united
with
each
other
,
and
with
the
many
existing
oceanic
islands
.
Several
facts
in
distribution
,
such
as
the
great
difference
in
the
marine
faunas
on
the
opposite
sides
of
almost
every
continent
,
the
close
relation
of
the
tertiary
inhabitants
of
several
lands
and
even
seas
to
their
present
inhabitants
,
the
degree
of
affinity
between
the
mammals
inhabiting
islands
with
those
of
the
nearest
continent
,
being
in
part
determined
(
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
)
by
the
depth
of
the
intervening
ocean
,
these
and
other
such
facts
are
opposed
to
the
admission
of
such
prodigious
geographical
revolutions
within
the
recent
period
,
as
are
necessary
on
the
view
advanced
by
Forbes
and
admitted
by
his
followers
.
The
nature
and
relative
proportions
of
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
are
likewise
opposed
to
the
belief
of
their
former
continuity
with
continents
.
Nor
does
the
almost
universally
volcanic
composition
of
such
islands
favour
the
admission
that
they
are
the
wrecks
of
sunken
continents
;
if
they
had
originally
existed
as
continental
mountain
ranges
,
some
at
least
of
the
islands
would
have
been
formed
,
like
other
mountain
summits
,
of
granite
,
metamorphic
schists
,
old
fossiliferous
and
other
rocks
,
instead
of
consisting
of
mere
piles
of
volcanic
matter
.
I
must
now
say
a
few
words
on
what
are
called
accidental
means
,
but
which
more
properly
should
be
called
occasional
means
of
distribution
.
I
shall
here
confine
myself
to
plants
.
In
botanical
works
,
this
or
that
plant
is
often
stated
to
be
ill
adapted
for
wide
dissemination
;
but
the
greater
or
less
facilities
for
transport
across
the
sea
may
be
said
to
be
almost
wholly
unknown
.
Until
I
tried
,
with
Mr
.
Berkeley's
aid
,
a
few
experiments
,
it
was
not
even
known
how
far
seeds
could
resist
the
injurious
action
of
sea
water
.
To
my
surprise
I
found
that
out
of
87
kinds
,
64
germinated
after
an
immersion
of
28
days
,
and
a
few
survived
an
immersion
of
137
days
.
It
deserves
notice
that
certain
orders
were
far
more
injured
than
others
:
nine
leguminosae
were
tried
,
and
,
with
one
exception
,
they
resisted
the
salt
water
badly
;
seven
species
of
the
allied
orders
,
Hydrophyllaceae
and
Polemoniacae
,
were
all
killed
by
a
month's
immersion
.
For
convenience'
sake
I
chiefly
tried
small
seeds
without
the
capsule
or
fruit
;
and
as
all
of
these
sank
in
a
few
days
they
could
not
have
been
floated
across
wide
spaces
of
the
sea
,
whether
or
not
they
were
injured
by
the
salt
water
.
Afterwards
I
tried
some
larger
fruits
,
capsules
,
&c
.
,
and
some
of
these
floated
for
a
long
time
.
It
is
well
known
what
a
difference
there
is
in
the
buoyancy
of
green
and
seasoned
timber
;
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
floods
would
often
wash
into
the
sea
dried
plants
or
branches
with
seed
capsules
or
fruit
attached
to
them
.
Hence
I
was
led
to
dry
the
stems
and
branches
of
94
plants
with
ripe
fruit
,
and
to
place
them
on
sea
water
.
The
majority
sank
rapidly
,
but
some
which
,
whilst
green
,
floated
for
a
short
time
,
when
dried
floated
much
longer
;
for
instance
,
ripe
hazel
nuts
sank
immediately
,
but
when
dried
they
floated
for
90
days
,
and
afterwards
when
planted
germinated
;
an
asparagus
plant
with
ripe
berries
floated
for
23
days
,
when
dried
it
floated
for
85
days
,
and
the
seeds
afterwards
germinated
;
the
ripe
seeds
of
Helosciadium
sank
in
two
days
,
when
dried
they
floated
for
above
90
days
,
and
afterwards
germinated
.
Altogether
,
out
of
the
94
dried
plants
,
18
floated
for
above
28
days
;
and
some
of
the
18
floated
for
a
very
much
longer
period
.
So
that
as
64/87
kinds
of
seeds
germinated
after
an
immersion
of
28
days
;
and
as
18/94
distinct
species
with
ripe
fruit
(
but
not
all
the
same
species
as
in
the
foregoing
experiment
)
floated
,
after
being
dried
,
for
above
28
days
,
we
may
conclude
,
as
far
as
anything
can
be
inferred
from
these
scanty
facts
,
that
the
seeds
of
14/100
kinds
of
plants
of
any
country
might
be
floated
by
sea
currents
during
28
days
,
and
would
retain
their
power
of
germination
.
In
Johnston's
Physical
Atlas
,
the
average
rate
of
the
several
Atlantic
currents
is
33
miles
per
diem
(
some
currents
running
at
the
rate
of
miles
per
diem
)
;
on
this
average
,
the
seeds
of
14/100
plants
belonging
to
one
country
might
be
floated
across
924
miles
of
sea
to
another
country
,
and
when
stranded
,
if
blown
by
an
inland
gale
to
a
favourable
spot
,
would
germinate
.
Subsequently
to
my
experiments
,
M
.
Martens
tried
similar
ones
,
but
in
a
much
better
manner
,
for
he
placed
the
seeds
in
a
box
in
the
actual
sea
,
so
that
they
were
alternately
wet
and
exposed
to
the
air
like
really
floating
plants
.
He
tried
98
seeds
,
mostly
different
from
mine
;
but
he
chose
many
large
fruits
and
likewise
seeds
from
plants
which
live
near
the
sea
;
and
this
would
have
favoured
both
the
average
length
of
their
flotation
and
their
resistance
to
the
injurious
action
of
the
salt
water
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
did
not
previously
dry
the
plants
or
branches
with
the
fruit
;
and
this
,
as
we
have
seen
,
would
have
caused
some
of
them
to
have
floated
much
longer
.
The
result
was
that
18/98ths
of
his
seeds
of
different
kinds
floated
for
42
days
,
and
were
then
capable
of
germination
.
But
I
do
not
doubt
that
plants
exposed
to
the
waves
would
float
for
a
less
time
than
those
protected
from
violent
movement
as
in
our
experiments
.
Therefore
it
would
perhaps
be
safer
to
assume
that
the
seeds
of
about
10/100
plants
of
a
flora
,
after
having
been
dried
,
could
be
floated
across
a
space
of
sea
900
miles
in
width
,
and
would
then
germinate
.
The
fact
of
the
larger
fruits
often
floating
longer
than
the
small
,
is
interesting
;
as
plants
with
large
seeds
or
fruit
which
,
as
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
shown
,
generally
have
restricted
ranges
,
could
hardly
be
transported
by
any
other
means
.
Seeds
may
be
occasionally
transported
in
another
manner
.
Drift
timber
is
thrown
up
on
most
islands
,
even
on
those
in
the
midst
of
the
widest
oceans
;
and
the
natives
of
the
coral
islands
in
the
Pacific
procure
stones
for
their
tools
,
solely
from
the
roots
of
drifted
trees
,
these
stones
being
a
valuable
royal
tax
.
I
find
that
when
irregularly
shaped
are
embedded
in
the
roots
of
trees
,
small
parcels
of
earth
are
frequently
enclosed
in
their
interstices
and
behind
them
,
so
perfectly
that
not
a
particle
could
be
washed
away
during
the
longest
transport
:
out
of
one
small
portion
of
earth
thus
completely
enclosed
by
the
roots
of
an
oak
about
50
years
old
,
three
dicotyledonous
plants
germinated
:
I
am
certain
of
the
accuracy
of
this
observation
.
Again
,
I
can
show
that
the
carcases
of
birds
,
when
floating
on
the
sea
,
sometimes
escape
being
immediately
devoured
:
and
many
kinds
of
seeds
in
the
crops
of
floating
birds
long
retain
their
vitality
:
peas
and
vetches
,
for
instance
,
are
killed
by
even
a
few
days'
immersion
in
sea
water
;
but
some
taken
out
of
the
crop
of
a
pigeon
,
which
had
floated
on
artificial
sea
water
for
30
days
,
to
my
surprise
nearly
all
germinated
.
Living
birds
can
hardly
fail
to
be
highly
effective
agents
in
the
transportation
of
seeds
.
I
could
give
many
facts
showing
how
frequently
birds
of
many
kinds
are
blown
by
gales
to
vast
distances
across
the
ocean
.
We
may
safely
assume
that
under
such
circumstances
their
rate
of
flight
would
often
be
35
miles
an
hour
;
and
some
authors
have
given
a
far
higher
estimate
.
I
have
never
seen
an
instance
of
nutritious
seeds
passing
through
the
intestines
of
a
bird
,
but
hard
seeds
of
fruit
pass
uninjured
through
even
the
digestive
organs
of
a
turkey
.
In
the
course
of
two
months
,
I
picked
up
in
my
garden
12
kinds
of
seeds
,
out
of
the
excrement
of
small
birds
,
and
these
seemed
perfect
,
and
some
of
them
,
which
were
tried
,
germinated
.
But
the
following
fact
is
more
important
:
the
crops
of
birds
do
not
secrete
gastric
juice
,
and
do
not
,
as
I
know
by
trial
,
injure
in
the
least
the
germination
of
seeds
;
now
,
after
a
bird
has
found
and
devoured
a
large
supply
of
food
,
it
is
positively
asserted
that
all
the
grains
do
not
pass
into
the
gizzard
for
twelve
or
even
eighteen
hours
.
A
bird
in
this
interval
might
easily
be
blown
to
the
distance
of
500
miles
,
and
hawks
are
known
to
look
out
for
tired
birds
,
and
the
contents
of
their
torn
crops
might
thus
readily
get
scattered
.
Some
hawks
and
owls
bolt
their
prey
whole
,
and
,
after
an
interval
of
from
twelve
to
twenty
hours
,
disgorge
pellets
,
which
,
as
I
know
from
experiments
made
in
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
include
seeds
capable
of
germination
.
Some
seeds
of
the
oat
,
wheat
,
millet
,
canary
,
hemp
,
clover
,
and
beet
germinated
after
having
been
from
twelve
to
twenty
one
hours
in
the
stomachs
of
different
birds
of
prey
;
and
two
seeds
of
beet
grew
after
having
been
thus
retained
for
two
days
and
fourteen
hours
.
Fresh
water
fish
,
I
find
,
eat
seeds
of
many
land
and
water
plants
;
fish
are
frequently
devoured
by
birds
,
and
thus
the
seeds
might
be
transported
from
place
to
place
.
I
forced
many
kinds
of
seeds
into
the
stomachs
of
dead
fish
,
and
then
gave
their
bodies
to
fishing
eagles
,
storks
,
and
pelicans
;
these
birds
,
after
an
interval
of
many
hours
,
either
rejected
the
seeds
in
pellets
or
passed
them
in
their
excrement
;
and
several
of
these
seeds
retained
the
power
of
germination
.
Certain
seeds
,
however
,
were
always
killed
by
this
process
.
Locusts
are
sometimes
blown
to
great
distances
from
the
land
;
I
myself
caught
one
370
miles
from
the
coast
of
Africa
,
and
have
heard
of
others
caught
at
greater
distances
.
The
Rev
.
R
.
T
.
Lowe
informed
Sir
C
.
Lyell
that
in
November
,
1844
,
swarms
of
locusts
visited
the
island
of
Madeira
.
They
were
in
countless
numbers
,
as
thick
as
the
flakes
of
snow
in
the
heaviest
snowstorm
,
and
extended
upwards
as
far
as
could
be
seen
with
a
telescope
.
During
two
or
three
days
they
slowly
careered
round
and
round
in
an
immense
ellipse
,
at
least
five
or
six
miles
in
diameter
,
and
at
night
alighted
on
the
taller
trees
,
which
were
completely
coated
with
them
.
They
then
disappeared
over
the
sea
,
as
suddenly
as
they
had
appeared
,
and
have
not
since
visited
the
island
.
Now
,
in
parts
of
Natal
it
is
believed
by
some
farmers
,
though
on
insufficient
evidence
,
that
injurious
seeds
are
introduced
into
their
grass
land
in
the
dung
left
by
the
great
flights
of
locusts
which
often
visit
that
country
.
In
consequence
of
this
belief
Mr
.
Weale
sent
me
in
a
letter
a
small
packet
of
the
dried
pellets
,
out
of
which
I
extracted
under
the
microscope
several
seeds
,
and
raised
from
them
seven
grass
plants
,
belonging
to
two
species
,
of
two
genera
.
Hence
a
swarm
of
locusts
,
such
as
that
which
visited
Madeira
,
might
readily
be
the
means
of
introducing
several
kinds
of
plants
into
an
island
lying
far
from
the
mainland
.
Although
the
beaks
and
feet
of
birds
are
generally
clean
,
earth
sometimes
adheres
to
them
:
in
one
case
I
removed
sixty
one
grains
,
and
in
another
case
twenty
two
grains
of
dry
argillaceous
earth
from
the
foot
of
a
partridge
,
and
in
the
earth
there
was
a
pebble
as
large
as
the
seed
of
a
vetch
.
Here
is
a
better
case
:
the
leg
of
a
woodcock
was
sent
to
me
by
a
friend
,
with
a
little
cake
of
dry
earth
attached
to
the
shank
,
weighing
only
nine
grains
;
and
this
contained
a
seed
of
the
toad
rush
(
Juncus
bufonius
)
which
germinated
and
flowered
.
Mr
.
Swaysland
,
of
Brighton
,
who
during
the
last
forty
years
has
paid
close
attention
to
our
migratory
birds
,
informs
me
that
he
has
often
shot
wagtails
(
Motacillae
)
,
wheat
ears
,
and
whinchats
(
Saxicolae
)
,
on
their
first
arrival
on
our
shores
,
before
they
had
alighted
;
and
he
has
several
times
noticed
little
cakes
of
earth
attached
to
their
feet
.
Many
facts
could
be
given
showing
how
generally
soil
is
charged
with
seeds
.
For
instance
,
Prof
.
Newton
sent
me
the
leg
of
a
red
legged
partridge
(
Caccabis
rufa
)
which
had
been
wounded
and
could
not
fly
,
with
a
ball
of
hard
earth
adhering
to
it
,
and
weighing
six
and
a
half
ounces
.
The
earth
had
been
kept
for
three
years
,
but
when
broken
,
watered
and
placed
under
a
bell
glass
,
no
less
than
82
plants
sprung
from
it
:
these
consisted
of
12
monocotyledons
,
including
the
common
oat
,
and
at
least
one
kind
of
grass
,
and
of
70
dicotyledons
,
which
consisted
,
judging
from
the
young
leaves
,
of
at
least
three
distinct
species
.
With
such
facts
before
us
,
can
we
doubt
that
the
many
birds
which
are
annually
blown
by
gales
across
great
spaces
of
ocean
,
and
which
annually
migrate
for
instance
,
the
millions
of
quails
across
the
Mediterranean
must
occasionally
transport
a
few
seeds
embedded
in
dirt
adhering
to
their
feet
or
beaks
?
But
I
shall
have
to
recur
to
this
subject
.
As
icebergs
are
known
to
be
sometimes
loaded
with
earth
and
stones
,
and
have
even
carried
brushwood
,
bones
,
and
the
nest
of
a
land
bird
,
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
they
must
occasionally
,
as
suggested
by
Lyell
,
have
transported
seeds
from
one
part
to
another
of
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
;
and
during
the
Glacial
period
from
one
part
of
the
now
temperate
regions
to
another
.
In
the
Azores
,
from
the
large
number
of
plants
common
to
Europe
,
in
comparison
with
the
species
on
the
other
islands
of
the
Atlantic
,
which
stand
nearer
to
the
mainland
,
and
(
as
remarked
by
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
)
from
their
somewhat
northern
character
in
comparison
with
the
latitude
,
I
suspected
that
these
islands
had
been
partly
stocked
by
ice
borne
seeds
,
during
the
Glacial
epoch
.
At
my
request
Sir
C
.
Lyell
wrote
to
M
.
Hartung
to
inquire
whether
he
had
observed
erratic
boulders
on
these
islands
,
and
he
answered
that
he
had
found
large
fragments
of
granite
and
other
rocks
,
which
do
not
occur
in
the
archipelago
.
Hence
we
may
safely
infer
that
icebergs
formerly
landed
their
rocky
burthens
on
the
shores
of
these
mid
ocean
islands
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
they
may
have
brought
thither
some
few
seeds
of
northern
plants
.
Considering
that
these
several
means
of
transport
,
and
that
other
means
,
which
without
doubt
remain
to
be
discovered
,
have
been
in
action
year
after
year
for
tens
of
thousands
of
years
,
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
a
marvellous
fact
if
many
plants
had
not
thus
become
widely
transported
.
These
means
of
transport
are
sometimes
called
accidental
,
but
this
is
not
strictly
correct
:
the
currents
of
the
sea
are
not
accidental
,
nor
is
the
direction
of
prevalent
gales
of
wind
.
It
should
be
observed
that
scarcely
any
means
of
transport
would
carry
seeds
for
very
great
distances
:
for
seeds
do
not
retain
their
vitality
when
exposed
for
a
great
length
of
time
to
the
action
of
sea
water
;
nor
could
they
be
long
carried
in
the
crops
or
intestines
of
birds
.
These
means
,
however
,
would
suffice
for
occasional
transport
across
tracts
of
sea
some
hundred
miles
in
breadth
,
or
from
island
to
island
,
or
from
a
continent
to
a
neighbouring
island
,
but
not
from
one
distant
continent
to
another
.
The
floras
of
distant
continents
would
not
by
such
means
become
mingled
;
but
would
remain
as
distinct
as
they
now
are
.
The
currents
,
from
their
course
,
would
never
bring
seeds
from
North
America
to
Britain
,
though
they
might
and
do
bring
seeds
from
the
West
Indies
to
our
western
shores
,
where
,
if
not
killed
by
their
very
long
immersion
in
salt
water
,
they
could
not
endure
our
climate
.
Almost
every
year
,
one
or
two
land
birds
are
blown
across
the
whole
Atlantic
Ocean
,
from
North
America
to
the
western
shores
of
Ireland
and
England
;
but
seeds
could
be
transported
by
these
rare
wanderers
only
by
one
means
,
namely
,
by
dirt
adhering
to
their
feet
or
beaks
,
which
is
in
itself
a
rare
accident
.
Even
in
this
case
,
how
small
would
be
the
chance
of
a
seed
falling
on
favourable
soil
,
and
coming
to
maturity!
But
it
would
be
a
great
error
to
argue
that
because
a
well
stocked
island
,
like
Great
Britain
,
has
not
,
as
far
as
is
known
(
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
this
)
,
received
within
the
last
few
centuries
,
through
occasional
means
of
transport
,
immigrants
from
Europe
or
any
other
continent
,
that
a
poorly
stocked
island
,
though
standing
more
remote
from
the
mainland
,
would
not
receive
colonists
by
similar
means
.
Out
of
a
hundred
kinds
of
seeds
or
animals
transported
to
an
island
,
even
if
far
less
well
stocked
than
Britain
,
perhaps
not
more
than
one
would
be
so
well
fitted
to
its
new
home
,
as
to
become
naturalised
.
But
this
is
no
valid
argument
against
what
would
be
effected
by
occasional
means
of
transport
,
during
the
long
lapse
of
geological
time
,
whilst
the
island
was
being
upheaved
,
and
before
it
had
become
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
.
On
almost
bare
land
,
with
few
or
no
destructive
insects
or
birds
living
there
,
nearly
every
seed
which
chanced
to
arrive
,
if
fitted
for
the
climate
,
would
germinate
and
survive
.
Dispersal
during
the
Glacial
Period
The
identity
of
many
plants
and
animals
,
on
mountain
summits
,
separated
from
each
other
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
lowlands
,
where
Alpine
species
could
not
possibly
exist
,
is
one
of
the
most
striking
cases
known
of
the
same
species
living
at
distant
points
without
the
apparent
possibility
of
their
having
migrated
from
one
point
to
the
other
.
It
is
indeed
a
remarkable
fact
to
see
so
many
plants
of
the
same
species
living
on
the
snowy
regions
of
the
Alps
or
Pyrenees
,
and
in
the
extreme
northern
parts
of
Europe
;
but
it
is
far
more
remarkable
,
that
the
plants
on
the
White
Mountains
,
in
the
United
States
of
America
,
are
all
the
same
with
those
of
Labrador
,
and
nearly
all
the
same
,
as
we
hear
from
Asa
Gray
,
with
those
on
the
loftiest
mountains
of
Europe
.
Even
as
long
ago
as
1747
,
such
facts
led
Gmelin
to
conclude
that
the
same
species
must
have
been
independently
created
at
many
distinct
points
;
and
we
might
have
remained
in
this
same
belief
,
had
not
Agassiz
and
others
called
vivid
attention
to
the
Glacial
period
,
which
,
as
we
shall
immediately
see
,
affords
a
simple
explanation
of
these
facts
.
We
have
evidence
of
almost
every
conceivable
kind
,
organic
and
inorganic
,
that
,
within
a
very
recent
geological
period
,
central
Europe
and
North
America
suffered
under
an
arctic
climate
.
The
ruins
of
a
house
burnt
by
fire
do
not
tell
their
tale
more
plainly
than
do
the
mountains
of
Scotland
and
Wales
,
with
their
scored
flanks
,
polished
surfaces
,
and
perched
boulders
,
of
the
icy
streams
with
which
their
valleys
were
lately
filled
.
So
greatly
has
the
climate
of
Europe
changed
,
that
in
northern
Italy
,
gigantic
moraines
,
left
by
old
glaciers
,
are
now
clothed
by
the
vine
and
maize
.
Throughout
a
large
part
of
the
United
States
,
erratic
boulders
and
scored
rocks
plainly
reveal
a
former
cold
period
.
The
former
influence
of
the
glacial
climate
on
the
distribution
of
the
inhabitants
of
Europe
,
as
explained
by
Edward
Forbes
,
is
substantially
as
follows
.
But
we
shall
follow
the
changes
more
readily
,
by
supposing
a
new
glacial
period
slowly
to
come
on
,
and
then
pass
away
,
as
formerly
occurred
.
As
the
cold
came
on
,
and
as
each
more
southern
zone
became
fitted
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
north
,
these
would
take
the
places
of
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
temperate
regions
.
The
latter
,
at
the
same
time
,
would
travel
further
and
further
southward
,
unless
they
were
stopped
by
barriers
,
in
which
case
they
would
perish
.
The
mountains
would
become
covered
with
snow
and
ice
,
and
their
former
Alpine
inhabitants
would
descend
to
the
plains
.
By
the
time
that
the
cold
had
reached
its
maximum
,
we
should
have
an
arctic
fauna
and
flora
,
covering
the
central
parts
of
Europe
,
as
far
south
as
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
and
even
stretching
into
Spain
.
The
now
temperate
regions
of
the
United
States
would
likewise
be
covered
by
arctic
plants
and
animals
and
these
would
be
nearly
the
same
with
those
of
Europe
;
for
the
present
circumpolar
inhabitants
,
which
we
suppose
to
have
everywhere
travelled
southward
,
are
remarkably
uniform
round
the
world
.
As
the
warmth
returned
,
the
arctic
forms
would
retreat
northward
,
closely
followed
up
in
their
retreat
by
the
productions
of
the
more
temperate
regions
.
And
as
the
snow
melted
from
the
bases
of
the
mountains
,
the
arctic
forms
would
seize
on
the
cleared
and
thawed
ground
,
always
ascending
,
as
the
warmth
increased
and
the
snow
still
further
disappeared
,
higher
and
higher
,
whilst
their
brethren
were
pursuing
their
northern
journey
.
Hence
,
when
the
warmth
had
fully
returned
,
the
same
species
,
which
had
lately
lived
together
on
the
European
and
North
American
lowlands
,
would
again
be
found
in
the
arctic
regions
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
,
and
on
many
isolated
mountain
summits
far
distant
from
each
other
.
Thus
we
can
understand
the
identity
of
many
plants
at
points
so
immensely
remote
as
the
mountains
of
the
United
States
and
those
of
Europe
.
We
can
thus
also
understand
the
fact
that
the
Alpine
plants
of
each
mountain
range
are
more
especially
related
to
the
arctic
forms
living
due
north
or
nearly
due
north
of
them
:
for
the
first
migration
when
the
cold
came
on
,
and
the
re
migration
on
the
returning
warmth
,
would
generally
have
been
due
south
and
north
.
The
Alpine
plants
,
for
example
,
of
Scotland
,
as
remarked
by
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
,
and
those
of
the
Pyrenees
,
as
remarked
by
Ramond
,
are
more
especially
allied
to
the
plants
of
northern
Scandinavia
;
those
of
the
United
States
to
Labrador
;
those
of
the
mountains
of
Siberia
to
the
arctic
regions
of
that
country
.
These
views
,
grounded
as
they
are
on
the
perfectly
well
ascertained
occurrence
of
a
former
Glacial
period
,
seem
to
me
to
explain
in
so
satisfactory
a
manner
the
present
distribution
of
the
Alpine
and
arctic
productions
of
Europe
and
America
,
that
when
in
other
regions
we
find
the
same
species
on
distant
mountain
summits
,
we
may
almost
conclude
,
without
other
evidence
,
that
a
colder
climate
formerly
permitted
their
migration
across
the
intervening
lowlands
,
now
become
too
warm
for
their
existence
.
As
the
arctic
forms
moved
first
southward
and
afterwards
backwards
to
the
north
,
in
unison
with
the
changing
climate
,
they
will
not
have
been
exposed
during
their
long
migration
to
any
great
diversity
of
temperature
;
and
as
they
all
migrated
in
a
body
together
,
their
mutual
relations
will
not
have
been
much
disturbed
.
Hence
,
in
accordance
with
the
principles
inculcated
in
this
volume
,
these
forms
will
not
have
been
liable
to
much
modification
.
But
with
the
Alpine
productions
,
left
isolated
from
the
moment
of
the
returning
warmth
,
first
at
the
bases
and
ultimately
on
the
summits
of
the
mountains
,
the
case
will
have
been
somewhat
different
;
for
it
is
not
likely
that
all
the
same
arctic
species
will
have
been
left
on
mountain
ranges
far
distant
from
each
other
,
and
have
survived
there
ever
since
;
they
will
also
in
all
probability
,
have
become
mingled
with
ancient
Alpine
species
,
which
must
have
existed
on
the
mountains
before
the
commencement
of
the
Glacial
epoch
,
and
which
during
the
coldest
period
will
have
been
temporarily
driven
down
to
the
plains
;
they
will
,
also
,
have
been
subsequently
exposed
to
somewhat
different
climatal
influences
.
Their
mutual
relations
will
thus
have
been
in
some
degree
disturbed
;
consequently
they
will
have
been
liable
to
modification
;
and
they
have
been
modified
;
for
if
we
compare
the
present
Alpine
plants
and
animals
of
the
several
great
European
mountain
ranges
one
with
another
,
though
many
of
the
species
remain
identically
the
same
,
some
exist
as
varieties
,
some
as
doubtful
forms
or
sub
species
,
and
some
as
distinct
yet
closely
allied
species
representing
each
other
on
the
several
ranges
.
In
the
foregoing
illustration
I
have
assumed
that
at
the
commencement
of
our
imaginary
Glacial
period
,
the
arctic
productions
were
as
uniform
round
the
polar
regions
as
they
are
at
the
present
day
.
But
it
is
also
necessary
to
assume
that
many
sub
arctic
and
some
few
temperate
forms
were
the
same
round
the
world
,
for
some
of
the
species
which
now
exist
on
the
lower
mountain
slopes
and
on
the
plains
of
North
America
and
Europe
are
the
same
;
and
it
may
be
asked
how
I
account
for
this
degree
of
uniformity
in
the
sub
arctic
and
temperate
forms
round
the
world
,
at
the
commencement
of
the
real
Glacial
period
.
At
the
present
day
,
the
sub
arctic
and
northern
temperate
productions
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
are
separated
from
each
other
by
the
whole
Atlantic
Ocean
and
by
the
northern
part
of
the
Pacific
.
During
the
Glacial
period
,
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
lived
farther
southward
than
they
do
at
present
,
they
must
have
been
still
more
completely
separated
from
each
other
by
wider
spaces
of
ocean
;
so
that
it
may
well
be
asked
how
the
same
species
could
then
or
previously
have
entered
the
two
continents
.
The
explanation
,
I
believe
,
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
climate
before
the
commencement
of
the
Glacial
period
.
At
this
,
the
newer
Pliocene
period
,
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
were
specifically
the
same
as
now
,
and
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
climate
was
warmer
than
at
the
present
day
.
Hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
organisms
which
now
live
under
latitude
60
,
lived
during
the
Pliocene
period
farther
north
under
the
Polar
Circle
,
in
latitude
66
67
;
and
that
the
present
arctic
productions
then
lived
on
the
broken
land
still
nearer
to
the
pole
.
Now
,
if
we
looked
at
a
terrestrial
globe
,
we
see
under
the
Polar
Circle
that
there
is
almost
continuous
land
from
western
Europe
,
through
Siberia
,
to
eastern
America
.
And
this
continuity
of
the
circumpolar
land
,
with
the
consequent
freedom
under
a
more
favourable
climate
for
intermigration
,
will
account
for
the
supposed
uniformity
of
the
sub
arctic
and
temperate
productions
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
,
at
a
period
anterior
to
the
Glacial
epoch
.
Believing
,
from
reasons
before
alluded
to
,
that
our
continents
have
long
remained
in
nearly
the
same
relative
position
,
though
subjected
to
great
oscillations
of
level
,
I
am
strongly
inclined
to
extend
the
above
view
,
and
to
infer
that
during
some
still
earlier
and
still
warmer
period
,
such
as
the
older
Pliocene
period
,
a
large
number
of
the
same
plants
and
animals
inhabited
the
almost
continuous
circumpolar
land
;
and
that
these
plants
and
animals
,
both
in
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
,
began
slowly
to
migrate
southwards
as
the
climate
became
less
warm
,
long
before
the
commencement
of
the
Glacial
period
.
We
now
see
,
as
I
believe
,
their
descendants
,
mostly
in
a
modified
condition
,
in
the
central
parts
of
Europe
and
the
United
States
.
On
this
view
we
can
understand
the
relationship
with
very
little
identity
,
between
the
productions
of
North
America
and
Europe
,
a
relationship
which
is
highly
remarkable
,
considering
the
distance
of
the
two
areas
,
and
their
separation
by
the
whole
Atlantic
Ocean
.
We
can
further
understand
the
singular
fact
remarked
on
by
several
observers
that
the
productions
of
Europe
and
America
during
the
later
tertiary
stages
were
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
they
are
at
the
present
time
;
for
during
these
warmer
periods
the
northern
parts
of
the
Old
and
New
Worlds
will
have
been
almost
continuously
united
by
land
,
serving
as
a
bridge
,
since
rendered
impassable
by
cold
,
for
the
intermigration
of
their
inhabitants
.
During
the
slowly
decreasing
warmth
of
the
Pliocene
period
,
as
soon
as
the
species
in
common
,
which
inhabited
the
New
and
Old
Worlds
,
migrated
south
of
the
Polar
Circle
,
they
will
have
been
completely
cut
off
from
each
other
.
This
separation
,
as
far
as
the
more
temperate
productions
are
concerned
,
must
have
taken
place
long
ages
ago
.
As
the
plants
and
animals
migrated
southwards
,
they
will
have
become
mingled
in
the
one
great
region
with
the
native
American
productions
,
and
would
have
had
to
compete
with
them
;
and
in
the
other
great
region
,
with
those
of
the
Old
World
.
Consequently
we
have
here
everything
favourable
for
much
modification
,
for
far
more
modification
than
with
the
Alpine
productions
,
left
isolated
,
within
a
much
more
recent
period
,
on
the
several
mountain
ranges
and
on
the
arctic
lands
of
Europe
and
N
.
America
.
Hence
it
has
come
,
that
when
we
compare
the
now
living
productions
of
the
temperate
regions
of
the
New
and
Old
Worlds
,
we
find
very
few
identical
species
(
though
Asa
Gray
has
lately
shown
that
more
plants
are
identical
than
was
formerly
supposed
)
,
but
we
find
in
every
great
class
many
forms
,
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
geographical
races
,
and
others
as
distinct
species
;
and
a
host
of
closely
allied
or
representative
forms
which
are
ranked
by
all
naturalists
as
specifically
distinct
.
As
on
the
land
,
so
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
,
a
slow
southern
migration
of
a
marine
fauna
,
which
,
during
the
Pliocene
or
even
a
somewhat
earlier
period
,
was
nearly
uniform
along
the
continuous
shores
of
the
Polar
Circle
,
will
account
,
on
the
theory
of
modification
,
for
many
closely
allied
forms
now
living
in
marine
areas
completely
sundered
.
Thus
,
I
think
,
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
some
closely
allied
,
still
existing
and
extinct
tertiary
forms
,
on
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
temperate
North
America
;
and
the
still
more
striking
fact
of
many
closely
allied
crustaceans
(
as
described
in
Dana's
admirable
work
)
,
some
fish
and
other
marine
animals
,
inhabiting
the
Mediterranean
and
the
seas
of
Japan
,
these
two
areas
being
now
completely
separated
by
the
breadth
of
a
whole
continent
and
by
wide
spaces
of
ocean
.
These
cases
of
close
relationship
in
species
either
now
or
formerly
inhabiting
the
seas
on
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
North
America
,
the
Mediterranean
and
Japan
,
and
the
temperate
lands
of
North
America
and
Europe
,
are
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
.
We
cannot
maintain
that
such
species
have
been
created
alike
,
in
correspondence
with
the
nearly
similar
physical
conditions
of
the
areas
;
for
if
we
compare
,
for
instance
,
certain
parts
of
South
America
with
parts
of
South
Africa
or
Australia
,
we
see
countries
closely
similar
in
all
their
physical
conditions
,
with
their
inhabitants
utterly
dissimilar
.
Alternate
Glacial
Periods
in
the
North
and
South
But
we
must
return
to
our
more
immediate
subject
.
I
am
convinced
that
Forbes's
view
may
be
largely
extended
.
In
Europe
we
meet
with
the
plainest
evidence
of
the
Glacial
period
,
from
the
western
shores
of
Britain
to
the
Oural
range
,
and
southward
to
the
Pyrenees
.
We
may
infer
from
the
frozen
mammals
and
nature
of
the
mountain
vegetation
,
that
Siberia
was
similarly
affected
.
In
the
Lebanon
,
according
to
Dr
.
Hooker
,
perpetual
snow
formerly
covered
the
central
axis
,
and
fed
glaciers
which
rolled
400
feet
down
the
valleys
.
The
same
observer
has
recently
found
great
moraines
at
a
low
level
on
the
Atlas
range
in
N
.
Africa
.
Along
the
Himalaya
,
at
points
900
miles
apart
,
glaciers
have
left
the
marks
of
their
former
low
descent
;
and
in
Sikkim
,
Dr
.
Hooker
saw
maize
growing
on
ancient
and
gigantic
moraines
.
Southward
of
the
Asiatic
continent
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
equator
,
we
know
,
from
the
excellent
researches
of
Dr
.
J
.
Haast
and
Dr
.
Hector
,
that
in
New
Zealand
immense
glaciers
formerly
descended
to
a
low
level
;
and
the
same
plants
found
by
Dr
.
Hooker
on
widely
separated
mountains
in
this
island
tell
the
same
story
of
a
former
cold
period
.
From
facts
communicated
to
me
by
the
Rev
.
W
.
B
.
Clarke
,
it
appears
also
that
there
are
traces
of
former
glacial
action
on
the
mountains
of
the
south
eastern
corner
of
Australia
.
Looking
to
America
;
in
the
northern
half
,
ice
borne
fragments
of
rock
have
been
observed
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
continent
,
as
far
south
as
lat
.
36
37
,
and
on
the
shores
of
the
Pacific
,
where
the
climate
is
now
so
different
,
as
far
south
as
lat
.
46
.
Erratic
boulders
have
,
also
,
been
noticed
on
the
Rocky
Mountains
.
In
the
Cordillera
of
South
America
,
nearly
under
the
equator
,
glaciers
once
extended
far
below
their
present
level
.
In
Central
Chile
I
examined
a
vast
mound
of
detritus
with
great
boulders
,
crossing
the
Portillo
valley
,
which
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
once
formed
a
huge
moraine
;
and
Mr
.
D
.
Forbes
informs
me
that
he
found
in
various
parts
of
the
Cordillera
,
from
lat
.
13
deg
.
to
30
deg
.
S
.
,
at
about
the
height
of
19
,
000
feet
,
deeply
furrowed
rocks
,
resembling
those
with
which
he
was
familiar
in
Norway
,
and
likewise
great
masses
of
detritus
,
including
grooved
pebbles
.
Along
this
whole
space
of
the
Cordillera
true
glaciers
do
not
exist
even
at
much
more
considerable
heights
.
Farther
south
on
both
sides
of
the
continent
,
from
lat
.
41
deg
.
to
the
southernmost
extremity
,
we
have
the
clearest
evidence
of
former
glacial
action
,
in
numerous
immense
boulders
transported
far
from
their
parent
source
.
From
these
several
facts
,
namely
from
the
glacial
action
having
extended
all
round
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
from
the
period
having
been
in
a
geological
sense
recent
in
both
hemispheres
from
its
having
lasted
in
both
during
a
great
length
of
time
,
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
amount
of
work
affected
and
lastly
from
glaciers
having
recently
descended
to
a
low
level
along
the
whole
line
of
the
Cordillera
,
it
at
one
time
appeared
to
me
that
we
could
not
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
temperature
of
the
whole
world
had
been
simultaneously
lowered
during
the
Glacial
period
.
But
now
Mr
.
Croll
,
in
a
series
of
admirable
memoirs
,
has
attempted
to
show
that
a
glacial
condition
of
climate
is
the
result
of
various
physical
causes
,
brought
into
operation
by
an
increase
in
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth's
orbit
.
All
these
causes
tend
towards
the
same
end
;
but
the
most
powerful
appears
to
be
the
indirect
influence
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
upon
oceanic
currents
.
According
to
Mr
.
Croll
,
cold
periods
regularly
occur
every
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
years
;
and
these
at
long
intervals
are
extremely
severe
,
owing
to
certain
contingencies
,
of
which
the
most
important
,
as
Sir
C
.
Lyell
has
shown
,
is
the
relative
position
of
the
land
and
water
.
Mr
.
Croll
believes
that
the
last
great
Glacial
period
occurred
about
240
,
000
years
ago
,
and
endured
with
slight
alterations
of
climate
for
about
160
,
000
years
.
With
respect
to
more
ancient
Glacial
periods
,
several
geologists
are
convinced
from
direct
evidence
that
such
occurred
during
the
Miocene
and
Eocene
formations
,
not
to
mention
still
more
ancient
formations
.
But
the
most
important
result
for
us
,
arrived
at
by
Mr
.
Croll
,
is
that
whenever
the
northern
hemisphere
passes
through
a
cold
period
the
temperature
of
the
southern
hemisphere
is
actually
raised
,
with
the
winters
rendered
much
milder
,
chiefly
through
changes
in
the
direction
of
the
ocean
currents
.
So
conversely
it
will
be
with
the
northern
hemisphere
,
whilst
the
southern
passes
through
a
Glacial
period
.
This
conclusion
throws
so
much
light
on
geographical
distribution
that
I
am
strongly
inclined
to
trust
in
it
;
but
I
will
first
give
the
facts
,
which
demand
an
explanation
.
In
South
America
,
Dr
.
Hooker
has
shown
that
besides
many
closely
allied
species
,
between
forty
and
fifty
of
the
flowering
plants
of
Tierra
del
Fuego
,
forming
no
inconsiderable
part
of
its
scanty
flora
,
are
common
to
North
America
and
Europe
,
enormously
remote
as
these
areas
in
opposite
hemispheres
are
from
each
other
.
On
the
lofty
mountains
of
equatorial
America
a
host
of
peculiar
species
belonging
to
European
genera
occur
.
On
the
Organ
mountains
of
Brazil
,
some
few
temperate
European
,
some
Antarctic
,
and
some
Andean
genera
were
found
by
Gardner
,
which
do
not
exist
in
the
low
intervening
hot
countries
.
On
the
Silla
of
Caraccas
,
the
illustrious
Humboldt
long
ago
found
species
belonging
to
genera
characteristic
of
the
Cordillera
.
In
Africa
,
several
forms
characteristic
of
Europe
and
some
few
representatives
of
the
flora
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
occur
in
the
mountains
of
Abyssinia
.
At
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
a
very
few
European
species
,
believed
not
to
have
been
introduced
by
man
,
and
on
the
mountains
several
representative
European
forms
are
found
,
which
have
not
been
discovered
in
the
intertropical
parts
of
Africa
.
Dr
.
Hooker
has
also
lately
shown
that
several
of
the
plants
living
on
the
upper
parts
of
the
lofty
island
of
Fernando
Po
and
on
the
neighbouring
Cameroon
mountains
,
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
are
closely
related
to
those
on
the
mountains
of
Abyssinia
,
and
likewise
to
those
of
temperate
Europe
.
It
now
also
appears
,
as
I
hear
from
Dr
.
Hooker
,
that
some
of
these
same
temperate
plants
have
been
discovered
by
the
Rev
.
R
.
T
.
Lowe
on
the
mountains
of
the
Cape
Verde
Islands
.
This
extension
of
the
same
temperate
forms
,
almost
under
the
equator
,
across
the
whole
continent
of
Africa
and
to
the
mountains
of
the
Cape
Verde
Archipelago
,
is
one
of
the
most
astonishing
facts
ever
recorded
in
the
distribution
of
plants
.
On
the
Himalaya
,
and
on
the
isolated
mountain
ranges
of
the
peninsula
of
India
,
on
the
heights
of
Ceylon
,
and
on
the
volcanic
cones
of
Java
,
many
plants
occur
,
either
identically
the
same
or
representing
each
other
,
and
at
the
same
time
representing
plants
of
Europe
,
not
found
in
the
intervening
hot
lowlands
.
A
list
of
the
genera
of
plants
collected
on
the
loftier
peaks
of
Java
,
raises
a
picture
of
a
collection
made
on
a
hillock
in
Europe!
Still
more
striking
is
the
fact
that
peculiar
Australian
forms
are
represented
by
certain
plants
growing
on
the
summits
of
the
mountains
of
Borneo
.
Some
of
these
Australian
forms
,
as
I
hear
from
Dr
.
Hooker
,
extend
along
the
heights
of
the
peninsula
of
Malacca
,
and
are
thinly
scattered
on
the
one
hand
over
India
,
and
on
the
other
hand
as
far
north
as
Japan
.
On
the
southern
mountains
of
Australia
,
Dr
.
F
.
Muller
has
discovered
several
European
species
;
other
species
,
not
introduced
by
man
,
occur
on
the
lowlands
;
and
a
long
list
can
be
given
,
as
I
am
informed
by
Dr
.
Hooker
,
of
European
genera
,
found
in
Australia
,
but
not
in
the
intermediate
torrid
regions
.
In
the
admirable
Introduction
to
the
Flora
of
New
Zealand
,
by
Dr
.
Hooker
,
analogous
and
striking
facts
are
given
in
regard
to
the
plants
of
that
large
island
.
Hence
we
see
that
certain
plants
growing
on
the
more
lofty
mountains
of
the
tropics
in
all
parts
of
the
world
,
and
on
the
temperate
plains
of
the
north
and
south
,
are
either
the
same
species
or
varieties
of
the
same
species
.
It
should
,
however
,
be
observed
that
these
plants
are
not
strictly
arctic
forms
;
for
,
as
Mr
.
H
.
C
.
Watson
has
remarked
,
"
in
receding
from
polar
towards
equatorial
latitudes
,
the
Alpine
or
mountain
floras
really
become
less
and
less
Arctic
.
"
Besides
these
identical
and
closely
allied
forms
,
many
species
inhabiting
the
same
widely
sundered
areas
,
belong
to
genera
not
now
found
in
the
intermediate
tropical
lowlands
.
These
brief
remarks
apply
to
plants
alone
;
but
some
few
analogous
facts
could
be
given
in
regard
to
terrestrial
animals
.
In
marine
productions
,
similar
cases
likewise
occur
;
as
an
example
,
I
may
quote
a
statement
by
the
highest
authority
,
Prof
.
Dana
,
that
"
It
is
certainly
a
wonderful
fact
that
New
Zealand
should
have
a
closer
resemblance
in
its
Crustacea
to
Great
Britain
,
its
antipode
,
than
to
any
other
part
of
the
world
.
"
Sir
J
.
Richardson
,
also
,
speaks
of
the
reappearance
on
the
shores
of
New
Zealand
,
Tasmania
,
&c
.
,
of
northern
forms
of
fish
.
Dr
.
Hooker
informs
me
that
twenty
five
species
of
Algae
are
common
to
New
Zealand
and
to
Europe
,
but
have
not
been
found
in
the
intermediate
tropical
seas
.
From
the
foregoing
facts
,
namely
,
the
presence
of
temperate
forms
on
the
highlands
across
the
whole
of
equatorial
Africa
,
and
along
the
Peninsula
of
India
,
to
Ceylon
and
the
Malay
Archipelago
,
and
in
a
less
well
marked
manner
across
the
wide
expanse
of
tropical
South
America
,
it
appears
almost
certain
that
at
some
former
period
,
no
doubt
during
the
most
severe
part
of
a
Glacial
period
,
the
lowlands
of
these
great
continents
were
everywhere
tenanted
under
the
equator
by
considerable
number
of
temperate
forms
.
At
this
period
the
equatorial
climate
at
the
level
of
the
sea
was
probably
about
the
same
with
that
now
experienced
at
the
height
of
from
five
to
six
thousand
feet
under
the
same
latitude
,
or
perhaps
even
rather
cooler
.
During
this
,
the
coldest
period
,
the
lowlands
under
the
equator
must
have
been
clothed
with
a
mingled
tropical
and
temperate
vegetation
,
like
that
described
by
Hooker
as
growing
luxuriantly
at
the
height
of
from
four
to
five
thousand
feet
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
Himalaya
,
but
with
perhaps
a
still
greater
preponderance
of
temperate
forms
.
So
again
in
the
mountainous
island
of
Fernando
Po
,
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
Mr
.
Mann
found
temperate
European
forms
beginning
to
appear
at
the
height
of
about
five
thousand
feet
.
On
the
mountains
of
Panama
,
at
the
height
of
only
two
thousand
feet
,
Dr
.
Seemann
found
the
vegetation
like
that
of
Mexico
,
"
with
forms
of
the
torrid
zone
harmoniously
blended
with
those
of
the
temperate
.
"
Now
let
us
see
whether
Mr
.
Croll's
conclusion
that
when
the
northern
hemisphere
suffered
from
the
extreme
cold
of
the
great
Glacial
period
,
the
southern
hemisphere
was
actually
warmer
,
throws
any
clear
light
on
the
present
apparently
inexplicable
distribution
of
various
organisms
in
the
temperate
parts
of
both
hemispheres
,
and
on
the
mountains
of
the
tropics
.
The
Glacial
period
,
as
measured
by
years
,
must
have
been
very
long
;
and
when
we
remember
over
what
vast
spaces
some
naturalised
plants
and
animals
have
spread
within
a
few
centuries
,
this
period
will
have
been
ample
for
any
amount
of
migration
.
As
the
cold
became
more
and
more
intense
,
we
know
that
arctic
forms
invaded
the
temperate
regions
;
and
,
from
the
facts
just
given
,
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
that
some
of
the
more
vigorous
,
dominant
,
and
widest
spreading
temperate
forms
invaded
the
equatorial
lowlands
.
The
inhabitants
of
these
hot
lowlands
would
at
the
same
time
have
migrated
to
the
tropical
and
subtropical
regions
of
the
south
,
for
the
southern
hemisphere
was
at
this
period
warmer
.
On
the
decline
of
the
Glacial
period
,
as
both
hemispheres
gradually
recovered
their
former
temperatures
,
the
northern
temperate
forms
living
on
the
lowlands
under
the
equator
,
would
have
been
driven
to
their
former
homes
or
have
been
destroyed
,
being
replaced
by
the
equatorial
forms
returning
from
the
south
.
Some
,
however
,
of
the
northern
temperate
forms
would
almost
certainly
have
ascended
any
adjoining
high
land
,
where
,
if
sufficiently
lofty
,
they
would
have
long
survived
like
the
arctic
forms
on
the
mountains
of
Europe
.
They
might
have
survived
,
even
if
the
climate
was
not
perfectly
fitted
for
them
,
for
the
change
of
temperature
must
have
been
very
slow
,
and
plants
undoubtedly
possess
a
certain
capacity
for
acclimatisation
,
as
shown
by
their
transmitting
to
their
offspring
different
constitutional
powers
of
resisting
heat
and
cold
.
In
the
regular
course
of
events
the
southern
hemisphere
would
in
its
turn
be
subjected
to
a
severe
Glacial
period
,
with
the
northern
hemisphere
rendered
warmer
;
and
then
the
southern
temperate
forms
would
invade
the
equatorial
lowlands
.
The
northern
forms
which
had
before
been
left
on
the
mountains
would
now
descend
and
mingle
with
the
southern
forms
.
These
latter
,
when
the
warmth
returned
,
would
return
to
their
former
homes
,
leaving
some
few
species
on
the
mountains
,
and
carrying
southward
with
them
some
of
the
northern
temperate
forms
which
had
descended
from
their
mountain
fastnesses
.
Thus
,
we
should
have
some
few
species
identically
the
same
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
and
on
the
mountains
of
the
intermediate
tropical
regions
.
But
the
species
left
during
a
long
time
on
these
mountains
,
or
in
opposite
hemispheres
,
would
have
to
compete
with
many
new
forms
and
would
be
exposed
to
somewhat
different
physical
conditions
;
hence
they
would
be
eminently
liable
to
modification
,
and
would
generally
now
exist
as
varieties
or
as
representative
species
;
and
this
is
the
case
.
We
must
,
also
,
bear
in
mind
the
occurrence
in
both
hemispheres
of
former
Glacial
periods
;
for
these
will
account
,
in
accordance
with
the
same
principles
,
for
the
many
quite
distinct
species
inhabiting
the
same
widely
separated
areas
,
and
belonging
to
genera
not
now
found
in
the
intermediate
torrid
zones
.
It
is
a
remarkable
fact
strongly
insisted
on
by
Hooker
in
regard
to
America
,
and
by
Alph
.
de
Candolle
in
regard
to
Australia
,
that
many
more
identical
or
slightly
modified
species
have
migrated
from
the
north
to
the
south
,
than
in
a
reversed
direction
.
We
see
,
however
,
a
few
southern
forms
on
the
mountains
of
Borneo
and
Abyssinia
.
I
suspect
that
this
preponderant
migration
from
the
north
to
the
south
is
due
to
the
greater
extent
of
land
in
the
north
,
and
to
the
northern
forms
having
existed
in
their
own
homes
in
greater
numbers
,
and
having
consequently
been
advanced
through
natural
selection
and
competition
to
a
higher
stage
of
perfection
,
or
dominating
power
,
than
the
southern
forms
.
And
thus
,
when
the
two
sets
became
commingled
in
the
equatorial
regions
,
during
the
alternations
to
the
Glacial
periods
,
the
northern
forms
were
the
more
powerful
and
were
able
to
hold
their
places
on
the
mountains
,
and
afterwards
to
migrate
southward
with
the
southern
forms
;
but
not
so
the
southern
in
regard
to
the
northern
forms
.
In
the
same
manner
at
the
present
day
,
we
see
that
very
many
European
productions
cover
the
ground
in
La
Plata
,
New
Zealand
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
Australia
,
and
have
beaten
the
natives
;
whereas
extremely
few
southern
forms
have
become
naturalised
in
any
part
of
the
northern
hemisphere
,
though
hides
,
wool
,
and
other
objects
likely
to
carry
seeds
have
been
largely
imported
into
Europe
during
the
last
two
or
three
centuries
from
La
Plata
and
during
the
last
forty
or
fifty
years
from
Australia
.
The
Neilgherrie
mountains
in
India
,
however
,
offer
a
partial
exception
;
for
here
,
as
I
hear
from
Dr
.
Hooker
,
Australian
forms
are
rapidly
sowing
themselves
and
becoming
naturalised
.
Before
the
last
great
Glacial
period
,
no
doubt
the
intertropical
mountains
were
stocked
with
endemic
Alpine
forms
;
but
these
have
almost
everywhere
yielded
to
the
more
dominant
forms
generated
in
the
larger
areas
and
more
efficient
workshops
of
the
north
.
In
many
islands
the
native
productions
are
nearly
equalled
,
or
even
outnumbered
,
by
those
which
have
become
naturalised
;
and
this
is
the
first
stage
towards
their
extinction
.
Mountains
are
islands
on
the
land
,
and
their
inhabitants
have
yielded
to
those
produced
within
the
larger
areas
of
the
north
,
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
inhabitants
of
real
islands
have
everywhere
yielded
and
are
still
yielding
to
continental
forms
naturalised
through
man's
agency
.
The
same
principles
apply
to
the
distribution
of
terrestrial
animals
and
of
marine
productions
,
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
,
and
on
the
intertropical
mountains
.
When
,
during
the
height
of
the
Glacial
period
,
the
ocean
currents
were
widely
different
to
what
they
now
are
,
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
temperate
seas
might
have
reached
the
equator
;
of
these
a
few
would
perhaps
at
once
be
able
to
migrate
southward
,
by
keeping
to
the
cooler
currents
,
whilst
others
might
remain
and
survive
in
the
colder
depths
until
the
southern
hemisphere
was
in
its
turn
subjected
to
a
glacial
climate
and
permitted
their
further
progress
;
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
,
according
to
Forbes
,
isolated
spaces
inhabited
by
arctic
productions
exist
to
the
present
day
in
the
deeper
parts
of
the
northern
temperate
seas
.
I
am
far
from
supposing
that
all
the
difficulties
in
regard
to
the
distribution
and
affinities
of
the
identical
and
allied
species
,
which
now
live
so
widely
separated
in
the
north
and
south
,
and
sometimes
on
the
intermediate
mountain
ranges
,
are
removed
on
the
views
above
given
.
The
exact
lines
of
migration
cannot
be
indicated
.
We
cannot
say
why
certain
species
and
not
others
have
migrated
;
why
certain
species
have
been
modified
and
have
given
rise
to
new
forms
,
whilst
others
have
remained
unaltered
.
We
cannot
hope
to
explain
such
facts
,
until
we
can
say
why
one
species
and
not
another
becomes
naturalised
by
man's
agency
in
a
foreign
land
;
why
one
species
ranges
twice
or
thrice
as
far
,
and
is
twice
or
thrice
as
common
,
as
another
species
within
their
own
homes
.
Various
special
difficulties
also
remain
to
be
solved
;
for
instance
,
the
occurrence
,
as
shown
by
Dr
.
Hooker
,
of
the
same
plants
at
points
so
enormously
remote
as
Kerguelen
Land
,
New
Zealand
,
and
Fuegia
;
but
icebergs
,
as
suggested
by
Lyell
,
may
have
been
concerned
in
their
dispersal
.
The
existence
at
these
and
other
distant
points
of
the
southern
hemisphere
,
of
species
,
which
,
though
distinct
,
belong
to
genera
exclusively
confined
to
the
south
,
is
a
more
remarkable
case
.
Some
of
these
species
are
so
distinct
,
that
we
cannot
suppose
that
there
has
been
time
since
the
commencement
of
the
last
Glacial
period
for
their
migration
and
subsequent
modification
to
the
necessary
degree
.
The
facts
seem
to
indicate
that
distinct
species
belonging
to
the
same
genera
have
migrated
in
radiating
lines
from
a
common
centre
;
and
I
am
inclined
to
look
in
the
southern
,
as
in
the
northern
hemisphere
,
to
a
former
and
warmer
period
,
before
the
commencement
of
the
last
Glacial
period
,
when
the
Antarctic
lands
,
now
covered
with
ice
,
supported
a
highly
peculiar
and
isolated
flora
.
It
may
be
suspected
that
before
this
flora
was
exterminated
during
the
last
Glacial
epoch
,
a
few
forms
had
been
already
widely
dispersed
to
various
points
of
the
southern
hemisphere
by
occasional
means
of
transport
,
and
by
the
aid
as
halting
places
,
of
now
sunken
islands
.
Thus
the
southern
shores
of
America
,
Australia
,
and
New
Zealand
may
have
become
slightly
tinted
by
the
same
peculiar
forms
of
life
.
Sir
C
.
Lyell
in
a
striking
passage
has
speculated
,
in
language
almost
identical
with
mine
,
on
the
effects
of
great
alterations
of
climate
throughout
the
world
on
geographical
distribution
.
And
we
have
now
seen
that
Mr
.
Croll's
conclusion
that
successive
Glacial
periods
in
the
one
hemisphere
coincide
with
warmer
periods
in
the
opposite
hemisphere
,
together
with
the
admission
of
the
slow
modification
of
species
,
explains
a
multitude
of
facts
in
the
distribution
of
the
same
and
of
the
allied
forms
of
life
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
.
The
living
waters
have
flowed
during
one
period
from
the
north
and
during
another
from
the
south
,
and
in
both
cases
have
reached
the
equator
;
but
the
stream
of
life
has
flowed
with
greater
force
from
the
north
than
in
the
opposite
direction
,
and
has
consequently
more
freely
inundated
the
south
.
As
the
tide
leaves
its
drift
in
horizontal
lines
,
rising
higher
on
the
shores
where
the
tide
rises
highest
,
so
have
the
living
waters
left
their
living
drift
on
our
mountain
summits
,
in
a
line
gently
rising
from
the
arctic
lowlands
to
a
great
altitude
under
the
equator
.
The
various
beings
thus
left
stranded
may
be
compared
with
savage
races
of
man
,
driven
up
and
surviving
in
the
mountain
fastnesses
of
almost
every
land
,
which
serves
as
a
record
,
full
of
interest
to
us
,
of
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
lowlands
.
CHAPTER

GEOGRAPHICAL
DISTRIBUTION
Continued
Fresh
water
Productions
AS
LAKES
and
river
systems
are
separated
from
each
other
by
barriers
of
land
,
it
might
have
been
thought
that
fresh
water
productions
would
not
have
ranged
widely
within
the
same
country
,
and
as
the
sea
is
apparently
a
still
more
formidable
barrier
,
that
they
would
never
have
extended
to
distant
countries
.
But
the
case
is
exactly
the
reverse
.
Not
only
have
many
fresh
water
species
,
belonging
to
different
classes
,
an
enormous
range
,
but
allied
species
prevail
in
a
remarkable
manner
throughout
the
world
.
When
first
collecting
in
the
fresh
waters
of
Brazil
,
I
well
remember
feeling
much
surprise
at
the
similarity
of
the
fresh
water
insects
,
shells
&c
.
,
and
at
the
dissimilarity
of
the
surrounding
terrestrial
beings
,
compared
with
those
of
Britain
.
But
the
wide
ranging
power
of
fresh
water
productions
can
,
I
think
,
in
most
cases
be
explained
by
their
having
become
fitted
,
in
a
manner
highly
useful
to
them
,
for
short
and
frequent
migrations
from
pond
to
pond
,
or
from
stream
to
stream
,
within
their
own
countries
;
and
liability
to
wide
dispersal
would
follow
from
this
capacity
as
an
almost
necessary
consequence
.
We
can
here
consider
only
a
few
cases
;
of
these
,
some
of
the
most
difficult
to
explain
are
presented
by
fish
.
It
was
formerly
believed
that
the
same
fresh
water
species
never
existed
on
two
continents
distant
from
each
other
.
But
Dr
.
Gunther
has
lately
shown
that
the
Galaxias
attenuatus
inhabits
Tasmania
,
New
Zealand
,
the
Falkland
Islands
,
and
the
mainland
of
South
America
.
This
is
a
wonderful
case
,
and
probably
indicates
dispersal
from
an
Antarctic
centre
during
a
former
warm
period
.
This
case
,
however
,
is
rendered
in
some
degree
less
surprising
by
the
species
of
this
genus
having
the
power
of
crossing
by
some
unknown
means
considerable
spaces
of
open
ocean
:
thus
there
is
one
species
common
to
New
Zealand
and
to
the
Auckland
Islands
,
though
separated
by
a
distance
of
about
230
miles
.
On
the
same
continent
fresh
water
fish
often
range
widely
,
and
as
if
capriciously
;
for
in
two
adjoining
river
systems
some
of
the
species
may
be
the
same
,
and
some
wholly
different
.
It
is
probable
that
they
are
occasionally
transported
by
what
may
be
called
accidental
means
.
Thus
fishes
still
alive
are
not
very
rarely
dropped
at
distant
points
by
whirlwinds
;
and
it
is
known
that
the
ova
retain
their
vitality
for
a
considerable
time
after
removal
from
the
water
.
Their
dispersal
may
,
however
,
be
mainly
attributed
to
changes
in
the
level
of
the
land
within
the
recent
period
,
causing
rivers
to
flow
into
each
other
.
Instances
,
also
,
could
be
given
of
this
having
occurred
during
floods
,
without
any
change
of
level
.
The
wide
difference
of
the
fish
on
the
opposite
sides
of
most
mountain
ranges
,
which
are
continuous
,
and
which
consequently
must
from
an
early
period
have
completely
prevented
the
inosculation
of
the
river
systems
on
the
two
sides
,
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
.
Some
fresh
water
fish
belong
to
very
ancient
forms
,
and
in
such
cases
there
will
have
been
ample
time
for
great
geographical
changes
,
and
consequently
time
and
means
for
much
migration
.
Moreover
,
Dr
.
Gunther
has
recently
been
led
by
several
considerations
to
infer
that
with
fishes
the
same
forms
have
a
long
endurance
.
Salt
water
fish
can
with
care
be
slowly
accustomed
to
live
in
fresh
water
;
and
,
according
to
Valenciennes'
there
is
hardly
a
single
group
of
which
an
the
members
are
confined
to
fresh
water
,
so
that
a
marine
species
belonging
to
a
fresh
water
group
might
travel
far
along
the
shores
of
the
sea
,
and
could
,
it
is
probable
,
become
adapted
without
much
difficulty
to
the
fresh
waters
of
a
distant
land
.
Some
species
of
fresh
water
shells
have
very
wide
ranges
,
and
allied
species
which
,
on
our
theory
,
are
descended
from
a
common
parent
,
and
must
have
proceeded
from
a
single
source
,
prevail
throughout
the
world
.
Their
distribution
at
first
perplexed
me
much
,
as
their
ova
are
not
likely
to
be
transported
by
birds
;
and
the
ova
,
as
well
as
the
adults
,
are
immediately
killed
by
sea
water
.
I
could
not
even
understand
how
some
naturalised
species
have
spread
rapidly
throughout
the
same
country
.
But
two
facts
,
which
I
have
observed
and
many
others
no
doubt
will
be
discovered
throw
some
light
on
this
subject
.
When
ducks
suddenly
emerge
from
a
pond
covered
with
duck
weed
,
I
have
twice
seen
these
little
plants
adhering
to
their
backs
;
and
it
has
happened
to
me
,
in
removing
a
little
duck
weed
from
one
aquarium
to
another
,
that
I
have
unintentionally
stocked
the
one
with
fresh
water
shells
from
the
other
.
But
another
agency
is
perhaps
more
effectual
:
I
suspended
the
feet
of
a
duck
in
an
aquarium
,
where
many
ova
of
fresh
water
shells
were
hatching
;
and
I
found
that
numbers
of
the
extremely
minute
and
just
hatched
shells
crawled
on
the
feet
,
and
clung
to
them
so
firmly
that
when
taken
out
of
the
water
they
could
not
be
jarred
off
,
though
at
a
somewhat
more
advanced
age
they
would
voluntarily
drop
off
.
These
just
hatched
molluscs
,
though
aquatic
in
their
nature
,
survived
on
the
duck's
feet
,
in
damp
air
,
from
twelve
to
twenty
hours
;
and
in
this
length
of
time
a
duck
or
heron
might
fly
at
least
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
,
and
if
blown
across
the
sea
to
an
oceanic
island
,
or
to
any
other
distant
point
,
would
be
sure
to
alight
on
a
pool
or
rivulet
.
Sir
Charles
Lyell
informs
me
that
a
Dytiscus
has
been
caught
with
an
Ancylus
(
a
fresh
water
shell
like
a
limpet
)
firmly
adhering
to
it
;
and
a
water
beetle
of
the
same
family
,
a
Colymbetes
,
once
flew
on
board
the
"
Beagle
,
"
when
forty
five
miles
distant
from
the
nearest
land
:
how
much
farther
it
might
have
been
blown
by
a
favouring
gale
no
one
can
tell
.
With
respect
to
plants
,
it
has
long
been
known
what
enormous
ranges
many
fresh
water
,
and
even
marsh
species
,
have
,
both
over
continents
and
to
the
most
remote
oceanic
islands
.
This
is
strikingly
illustrated
,
according
to
Alph
.
de
Candolle
,
in
those
large
groups
of
terrestrial
plants
,
which
have
very
few
aquatic
members
;
for
the
latter
seem
immediately
to
acquire
,
as
if
in
consequence
,
a
wide
range
.
I
think
favourable
means
of
dispersal
explain
this
fact
.
I
have
before
mentioned
that
earth
occasionally
adheres
in
some
quantity
to
the
feet
and
beaks
of
birds
.
Wading
birds
,
which
frequent
the
muddy
edges
of
ponds
,
if
suddenly
flushed
,
would
be
the
most
likely
to
have
muddy
feet
.
Birds
of
this
order
wander
more
than
those
of
any
other
;
and
they
are
occasionally
found
on
the
most
remote
and
barren
islands
of
the
open
ocean
;
they
would
not
be
likely
to
alight
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
,
so
that
any
dirt
on
their
feet
would
not
be
washed
off
;
and
when
gaining
the
land
,
they
would
be
sure
to
fly
to
their
natural
fresh
water
haunts
.
I
do
not
believe
that
botanists
are
aware
how
charged
the
mud
of
ponds
is
with
seeds
;
I
have
tried
several
little
experiments
,
but
will
here
give
only
the
most
striking
case
:
I
took
in
February
three
tablespoonfuls
of
mud
from
three
different
points
,
beneath
water
,
on
the
edge
of
a
little
pond
:
this
mud
when
dried
weighed
only
63/4
ounces
;
I
kept
it
covered
up
in
my
study
for
six
months
,
pulling
up
and
counting
each
plant
as
it
grew
;
the
plants
were
of
many
kinds
,
and
were
altogether
537
in
number
;
and
yet
the
viscid
mud
was
all
contained
in
a
breakfast
cup!
Considering
these
facts
,
I
think
it
would
be
an
inexplicable
circumstance
if
water
birds
did
not
transport
the
seeds
of
fresh
water
plants
to
unstocked
ponds
and
streams
,
situated
at
very
distant
points
.
The
same
agency
may
have
come
into
play
with
the
eggs
of
some
of
the
smaller
fresh
water
animals
.
Other
and
unknown
agencies
probably
have
also
played
a
part
.
I
have
stated
that
fresh
water
fish
eat
some
kinds
of
seeds
,
though
they
reject
many
other
kinds
after
having
swallowed
them
;
even
small
fish
swallow
seeds
of
moderate
size
,
as
of
the
yellow
water
lily
and
Potamogeton
.
Herons
and
other
birds
,
century
after
century
,
have
gone
on
daily
devouring
fish
;
they
then
take
flight
and
go
to
other
waters
,
or
are
blown
across
the
sea
;
and
we
have
seen
that
seeds
retain
their
power
of
germination
,
when
rejected
many
hours
afterwards
in
pellets
or
in
the
excrement
.
When
I
saw
the
great
size
of
the
seeds
of
that
fine
water
lily
,
the
Nelumbium
,
and
remembered
Alph
.
de
Candolle's
remarks
on
the
distribution
of
this
plant
,
I
thought
that
the
means
of
its
dispersal
must
remain
inexplicable
;
but
Audubon
states
that
he
found
the
seeds
of
the
great
southern
water
lily
(
probably
,
according
to
Dr
.
Hooker
,
the
Nelumbium
luteum
)
in
a
heron's
stomach
.
Now
this
bird
must
often
have
flown
with
its
stomach
thus
well
stocked
to
distant
ponds
,
and
then
getting
a
hearty
meal
of
fish
,
analogy
makes
me
believe
that
it
would
have
rejected
the
seeds
in
a
pellet
in
a
fit
state
for
germination
.
In
considering
these
several
means
of
distribution
,
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
a
pond
or
stream
is
first
formed
,
for
instance
,
on
a
rising
islet
,
it
will
be
unoccupied
;
and
a
single
seed
or
egg
will
have
a
good
chance
of
succeeding
.
Although
there
will
always
be
a
struggle
for
life
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
pond
,
however
few
in
kind
,
yet
as
the
number
even
in
a
well
stocked
pond
is
small
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
species
inhabiting
an
equal
area
of
land
,
the
competition
between
them
will
probably
be
less
severe
than
between
terrestrial
species
;
consequently
an
intruder
from
the
waters
of
a
foreign
country
would
have
a
better
chance
of
seizing
on
new
place
,
than
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
colonists
.
We
should
also
remember
that
many
fresh
water
productions
are
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
,
and
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
such
beings
become
modified
more
slowly
than
the
high
;
and
this
will
give
time
for
the
migration
of
aquatic
species
.
We
should
not
forget
the
probability
of
many
fresh
water
forms
laving
formerly
ranged
continuously
over
immense
areas
,
and
then
having
become
extinct
at
intermediate
points
.
But
the
wide
distribution
of
fresh
water
plants
and
of
the
lower
animals
,
whether
retaining
the
same
identical
form
or
in
some
degree
modified
,
apparently
depends
in
main
part
on
the
wide
dispersal
of
their
seeds
and
eggs
by
animals
,
more
especially
by
fresh
water
birds
,
which
have
great
powers
of
flight
,
and
naturally
travel
from
one
piece
of
water
to
another
.
On
the
Inhabitants
of
Oceanic
Islands
We
now
come
to
the
last
of
the
three
classes
of
facts
,
which
I
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest
amount
of
difficulty
with
respect
to
distribution
,
on
the
view
that
not
only
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
have
migrated
from
some
one
area
,
but
that
allied
species
,
although
now
inhabiting
the
most
distant
points
,
have
proceeded
from
a
single
area
,
the
birthplace
of
their
early
progenitors
.
I
have
already
given
my
reasons
for
disbelieving
in
continental
extensions
within
the
period
of
existing
species
,
on
so
enormous
a
scale
that
all
the
many
islands
of
the
several
oceans
were
thus
stocked
with
their
present
terrestrial
inhabitants
.
This
view
removes
many
difficulties
,
but
it
does
not
accord
with
all
the
facts
in
regard
to
the
productions
of
islands
.
In
the
following
remarks
I
shall
not
confine
myself
to
the
mere
question
of
dispersal
,
but
shall
consider
some
other
cases
bearing
on
the
truth
of
the
two
theories
of
independent
creation
and
of
descent
with
modification
.
The
species
of
all
kinds
which
inhabit
oceanic
islands
are
few
in
number
compared
with
those
on
equal
continental
areas
:
Alph
.
de
Candolle
admits
this
for
plants
,
and
Wollaston
for
insects
.
New
Zealand
,
for
instance
,
with
its
lofty
mountains
and
diversified
stations
,
extending
over
780
miles
of
latitude
,
together
with
the
outlying
islands
of
Auckland
,
Campbell
and
Chatham
,
contain
altogether
only
960
kinds
of
flowering
plants
;
if
we
compare
this
moderate
number
with
the
species
which
swarm
over
equal
areas
in
South
Western
Australia
or
at
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
we
must
admit
that
some
cause
,
independently
of
different
physical
conditions
,
has
given
rise
to
so
great
a
difference
in
number
.
Even
the
uniform
county
of
Cambridge
has
847
plants
,
and
the
little
island
of
Anglesea
764
,
but
a
few
ferns
and
a
few
introduced
plants
are
included
in
these
numbers
,
and
the
comparison
in
some
other
respects
is
not
quite
fair
.
We
have
evidence
that
the
barren
island
of
Ascension
aboriginally
possessed
less
than
half
a
dozen
flowering
plants
;
yet
many
species
have
now
become
naturalised
on
it
,
as
they
have
in
New
Zealand
and
on
every
other
oceanic
island
which
can
be
named
.
In
St
.
Helena
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
naturalised
plants
and
animals
have
nearly
or
quite
exterminated
many
native
productions
.
He
who
admits
the
doctrine
of
the
creation
of
each
separate
species
,
will
have
to
admit
that
a
sufficient
number
of
the
best
adapted
plants
and
animals
were
not
created
for
oceanic
islands
;
for
man
has
unintentionally
stocked
them
far
more
fully
and
perfectly
than
did
nature
.
Although
in
oceanic
islands
the
species
are
few
in
number
,
the
proportion
of
endemic
kinds
(
i
.
e
.
,
those
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
)
is
often
extremely
large
.
If
we
compare
,
for
instance
,
the
number
of
endemic
landshells
in
Madeira
,
or
of
endemic
birds
in
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
with
the
number
found
on
any
continent
,
and
then
compare
the
area
of
the
island
with
that
of
the
continent
,
we
shall
see
that
this
is
true
.
This
fact
might
have
been
theoretically
expected
,
for
,
as
already
explained
,
species
occasionally
arriving
after
long
intervals
of
time
in
the
new
and
isolated
district
,
and
having
to
compete
with
new
associates
,
would
be
eminently
liable
to
modification
,
and
would
often
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
.
But
it
by
no
means
follows
that
,
because
in
an
island
nearly
all
the
species
of
one
class
are
peculiar
,
those
of
another
class
,
or
of
another
section
of
the
same
class
,
are
peculiar
;
and
this
difference
seems
to
depend
partly
on
the
species
which
are
not
modified
having
immigrated
in
a
body
,
so
that
their
mutual
relations
have
not
been
much
disturbed
;
and
partly
on
the
frequent
arrival
of
unmodified
immigrants
from
the
mother
country
,
with
which
the
insular
forms
have
intercrossed
.
It
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
offspring
of
such
crosses
would
certainly
gain
in
vigour
,
so
that
even
an
occasional
cross
would
produce
more
effect
than
might
have
been
anticipated
.
I
will
give
a
few
illustrations
of
the
foregoing
remarks
:
in
the
Galapagos
Islands
there
are
9
.
6
land
birds
;
of
these
21
(
or
perhaps
93
)
are
peculiar
,
whereas
of
the
11
marine
birds
only
2
are
peculiar
;
and
it
is
obvious
that
marine
birds
could
arrive
at
these
islands
much
more
easily
and
frequently
than
land
birds
.
Bermuda
,
on
the
other
hand
,
which
lies
at
about
the
same
distance
from
North
America
as
the
Galapagos
Islands
do
from
South
America
,
and
which
has
a
very
peculiar
soil
,
does
not
possess
a
single
endemic
landbird
,
and
we
know
from
Mr
.
J
.
M
.
Jones's
admirable
account
of
Bermuda
,
that
very
many
North
American
birds
occasionally
or
even
frequently
visit
this
,
island
.
Almost
every
year
,
as
I
am
informed
by
Mr
.
E
.
V
.
Harcourt
,
many
European
and
African
birds
are
blown
to
Madeira
;
this
island
is
inhabited
by
99
kinds
of
which
one
alone
is
peculiar
,
though
very
closely
related
to
a
European
form
;
and
three
or
four
other
species
are
confined
to
this
island
and
to
the
Canaries
.
So
that
the
islands
of
Bermuda
and
Madeira
have
been
stocked
from
the
neighbouring
continents
with
birds
,
which
for
long
ages
have
there
struggled
together
,
and
have
become
mutually
co
adapted
.
Hence
when
settled
in
their
new
homes
,
each
kind
will
have
been
kept
by
the
others
to
its
proper
place
and
habits
,
and
will
consequently
have
been
but
little
liable
to
modification
.
Any
tendency
to
modification
will
also
have
been
checked
by
intercrossing
with
the
unmodified
immigrants
,
often
arriving
from
the
mother
country
.
Madeira
again
is
inhabited
by
a
wonderful
number
of
peculiar
land
shells
,
whereas
not
one
species
of
sea
shell
is
peculiar
to
its
shores
:
now
,
though
we
do
not
know
how
seashells
are
dispersed
,
yet
we
can
see
that
their
eggs
or
larvae
,
perhaps
attached
to
seaweed
or
floating
timber
,
or
to
the
feet
of
wading
birds
,
might
be
transported
across
three
or
four
hundred
miles
of
open
sea
far
more
easily
than
land
shells
.
The
different
orders
of
insects
inhabiting
Madeira
present
nearly
parallel
cases
.
Oceanic
islands
are
sometimes
deficient
in
animals
of
certain
whole
classes
,
and
their
places
are
occupied
by
other
classes
;
thus
in
the
Galapagos
Islands
reptiles
,
and
in
New
Zealand
gigantic
wingless
birds
,
take
,
or
recently
took
,
the
place
of
mammals
.
Although
New
Zealand
is
here
spoken
of
as
an
oceanic
island
,
it
is
in
some
degree
doubtful
whether
it
should
be
so
ranked
;
it
is
of
large
size
,
and
is
not
separated
from
Australia
by
a
profoundly
deep
sea
;
from
its
geological
character
and
the
direction
of
its
mountain
ranges
,
the
Rev
.
W
.
B
.
Clarke
has
lately
maintained
that
this
island
,
as
well
as
New
Caledonia
,
should
be
considered
as
appurtenances
of
Australia
.
Turning
to
plants
,
Dr
.
Hooker
has
shown
that
in
the
Galapagos
Islands
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
different
orders
are
very
different
from
what
they
are
elsewhere
.
All
such
differences
in
number
,
and
the
absence
of
certain
whole
groups
of
animals
and
plants
,
are
generally
accounted
for
by
supposed
differences
in
the
physical
conditions
of
the
islands
;
but
this
explanation
is
not
a
little
doubtful
.
Facility
of
immigration
seems
to
have
been
fully
as
important
as
the
nature
of
the
conditions
.
Many
remarkable
little
facts
could
be
given
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
.
For
instance
,
in
certain
islands
not
tenanted
by
a
single
mammal
,
some
of
the
endemic
plants
have
beautifully
hooked
seeds
;
yet
few
relations
are
more
manifest
than
that
hooks
serve
for
the
transportal
of
seeds
in
the
wool
or
fur
of
quadrupeds
.
But
a
hooked
seed
might
be
carried
to
an
island
by
other
means
;
and
the
plant
then
becoming
modified
would
form
an
endemic
species
,
still
retaining
its
hooks
,
which
would
form
a
useless
appendage
like
the
shrivelled
wings
under
the
soldered
wing
covers
of
many
insular
beetles
.
Again
,
islands
often
possess
trees
or
bushes
belonging
to
orders
which
elsewhere
include
only
herbaceous
species
;
now
trees
,
as
Alph
.
de
Candolle
has
shown
,
generally
have
,
whatever
the
cause
may
be
,
confined
ranges
.
Hence
trees
would
be
little
likely
to
reach
distant
oceanic
islands
;
and
an
herbaceous
plant
,
which
had
no
chance
of
successfully
competing
with
the
many
fully
developed
trees
growing
on
a
continent
,
might
,
when
established
on
an
island
,
gain
an
advantage
over
other
herbaceous
plants
by
growing
taller
and
taller
and
overtopping
them
.
In
this
case
,
natural
selection
would
tend
to
add
to
the
stature
of
the
plant
,
to
whatever
order
it
belonged
,
and
thus
first
convert
it
into
a
bush
and
then
into
a
tree
.
Absence
of
Batrachians
and
Terrestrial
Mammals
on
Oceanic
Islands
With
respect
to
the
absence
of
whole
orders
of
animals
on
oceanic
islands
,
Bory
St
.
Vincent
long
ago
remarked
that
batrachians
(
frogs
,
toads
,
newts
)
are
never
found
on
any
of
the
many
islands
with
which
the
great
oceans
are
studded
.
I
have
taken
pains
to
verify
this
assertion
,
and
have
found
it
true
,
with
the
exception
of
New
Zealand
,
New
Caledonia
,
the
Andaman
Islands
,
and
perhaps
the
Solomon
Islands
and
the
Seychelles
.
But
I
have
already
remarked
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
New
Zealand
and
New
Caledonia
ought
to
be
classed
as
oceanic
islands
;
and
this
is
still
more
doubtful
with
respect
to
the
Andaman
and
Solomon
groups
and
the
Seychelles
.
This
general
absence
of
frogs
,
toads
,
and
newts
on
so
many
true
oceanic
islands
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
their
physical
conditions
:
indeed
it
seems
that
islands
are
peculiarly
fitted
for
these
animals
;
for
frogs
have
been
introduced
into
Madeira
,
the
Azores
,
and
Mauritius
,
and
have
multiplied
so
as
to
become
a
nuisance
.
But
as
these
animals
and
their
spawn
are
immediately
killed
(
with
the
exception
,
as
far
as
known
,
of
one
Indian
species
)
by
sea
water
,
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
their
transportal
across
the
sea
,
and
therefore
we
can
see
why
they
do
not
exist
on
strictly
oceanic
islands
.
But
why
,
on
the
theory
of
creation
,
they
should
not
have
been
created
there
,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
.
Mammals
offer
another
and
similar
case
.
I
have
carefully
searched
the
oldest
voyages
,
and
have
not
found
a
single
instance
,
free
from
doubt
,
of
a
terrestrial
mammal
(
excluding
domesticated
animals
kept
by
the
natives
)
inhabiting
an
island
situated
above
300
miles
from
a
continent
or
great
continental
island
;
and
many
islands
situated
at
a
much
less
distance
are
equally
barren
.
The
Falkland
Islands
,
which
are
inhabited
by
a
wolf
like
fox
,
come
nearest
to
an
exception
;
but
this
group
cannot
be
considered
as
oceanic
,
as
it
lies
on
a
bank
in
connection
with
the
mainland
at
the
distance
of
about
280
miles
;
moreover
,
icebergs
formerly
brought
boulders
to
its
western
shores
,
and
they
may
have
formerly
transported
foxes
,
as
now
frequently
happens
in
the
arctic
regions
.
Yet
it
cannot
be
said
that
small
islands
will
not
support
at
least
small
mammals
,
for
they
occur
in
many
parts
of
the
world
on
very
small
islands
,
when
lying
close
to
a
continent
;
and
hardly
an
island
can
be
named
on
which
our
smaller
quadrupeds
have
not
become
naturalised
and
greatly
multiplied
.
It
cannot
be
said
,
on
the
ordinary
view
of
creation
,
that
there
has
not
been
time
for
the
creation
of
mammals
;
many
volcanic
islands
are
sufficiently
ancient
,
as
shown
by
the
stupendous
degradation
which
they
have
suffered
,
and
by
their
tertiary
strata
:
there
has
also
been
time
for
the
production
of
endemic
species
belonging
to
other
classes
;
and
on
continents
it
is
known
that
new
species
of
mammals
appear
and
disappear
at
a
quicker
rate
than
other
and
lower
animals
.
Although
terrestrial
mammals
do
not
occur
on
oceanic
islands
,
aerial
mammals
do
occur
on
almost
every
island
.
New
Zealand
possesses
two
bats
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
:
Norfolk
Island
,
the
Viti
Archipelago
,
the
Bonin
Islands
,
the
Caroline
and
Marianne
Archipelagoes
,
and
Mauritius
,
all
possess
their
peculiar
bats
.
Why
,
it
may
be
asked
,
has
the
supposed
creative
force
produced
bats
and
no
other
mammals
on
remote
islands
?
On
my
view
this
question
can
easily
be
answered
;
for
no
terrestrial
mammal
can
be
transported
across
a
wide
space
of
sea
,
but
bats
can
fly
across
.
Bats
have
been
seen
wandering
by
day
far
over
the
Atlantic
Ocean
;
and
two
North
American
species
either
regularly
or
occasionally
visit
Bermuda
,
at
the
distance
of
600
miles
from
the
mainland
.
I
hear
from
Mr
.
Tomes
,
who
has
specially
studied
this
family
,
that
many
species
have
enormous
ranges
,
and
are
found
on
continents
and
on
far
distant
islands
.
Hence
we
have
only
to
suppose
that
such
wandering
species
have
been
modified
in
their
new
homes
in
relation
to
their
new
position
,
and
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
endemic
bats
on
oceanic
islands
,
with
the
absence
of
all
other
terrestrial
mammals
.
Another
interesting
relation
exists
,
namely
,
between
the
depth
of
the
sea
separating
islands
from
each
other
or
from
the
nearest
continent
,
and
the
degree
of
affinity
of
their
mammalian
inhabitants
.
Mr
.
Windsor
Earl
has
made
some
striking
observations
on
this
head
,
since
greatly
extended
by
Mr
.
Wallace's
admirable
researches
,
in
regard
to
the
great
Malay
Archipelago
,
which
is
traversed
near
Celebes
by
a
space
of
deep
ocean
,
and
this
separates
two
widely
distinct
mammalian
faunas
.
On
either
side
the
islands
stand
on
a
moderately
shallow
submarine
bank
,
and
these
islands
are
inhabited
by
the
same
or
by
closely
allied
quadrupeds
.
I
have
not
as
yet
had
time
to
follow
up
this
subject
in
all
quarters
of
the
world
;
but
as
far
as
I
have
gone
,
the
relation
holds
good
.
For
instance
,
Britain
is
separated
by
a
shallow
channel
from
Europe
,
and
the
mammals
are
the
same
on
both
sides
;
and
so
it
is
with
all
the
islands
near
the
shores
of
Australia
.
The
West
Indian
Islands
,
on
the
other
hand
,
stand
on
a
deeply
submerged
bank
,
nearly
1000
fathoms
in
depth
,
and
here
we
find
American
forms
,
but
the
species
and
even
the
genera
are
quite
distinct
.
As
the
amount
of
modification
which
animals
of
all
kinds
undergo
partly
depends
on
the
lapse
of
time
,
and
as
the
islands
which
are
separated
from
each
other
or
from
the
mainland
by
shallow
channels
,
are
more
likely
to
have
been
continuously
united
within
a
recent
period
than
the
islands
separated
by
deeper
channels
,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
a
relation
exists
between
the
depth
of
the
sea
separating
two
mammalian
faunas
,
and
the
degree
of
their
affinity
,
a
relation
which
is
quite
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
independent
acts
of
creation
.
The
foregoing
statements
in
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
,
namely
,
the
fewness
of
the
species
,
with
a
large
proportion
consisting
of
endemic
forms
,
the
members
of
certain
groups
,
but
not
those
of
other
groups
in
the
same
class
,
having
been
modified
,
the
absence
of
certain
whole
orders
,
as
of
batrachians
and
of
terrestrial
mammals
,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
aerial
bats
,
the
singular
proportions
of
certain
orders
of
plants
,
herbaceous
forms
having
been
developed
into
trees
,
&c
.
,
seem
to
me
to
accord
better
with
the
belief
in
the
efficiency
of
occasional
means
of
transport
,
carried
on
during
a
long
course
of
time
,
than
with
the
belief
in
the
former
connection
of
all
oceanic
islands
with
the
nearest
continent
;
for
on
this
latter
view
it
is
probable
that
the
various
classes
would
have
immigrated
more
uniformly
,
and
from
the
species
having
entered
in
a
body
their
mutual
relations
would
not
have
been
much
disturbed
,
and
consequently
they
would
either
have
not
been
modified
,
or
all
the
species
in
a
more
equable
manner
.
I
do
not
deny
that
there
are
many
and
serious
difficulties
in
understanding
how
many
Of
the
inhabitants
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
more
remote
islands
,
whether
still
retaining
the
same
specific
form
or
subsequently
modified
,
have
reached
their
present
homes
.
But
the
probability
of
other
islands
having
once
existed
as
halting
places
,
of
which
not
a
wreck
now
remains
,
must
not
be
overlooked
.
I
will
specify
one
difficult
case
.
Almost
all
oceanic
islands
,
even
the
most
isolated
and
smallest
,
are
inhabited
by
landshells
,
generally
by
endemic
species
,
but
sometimes
by
species
found
elsewhere
,
striking
instances
of
which
have
been
given
by
Dr
.
A
.
A
.
Gould
in
relation
to
the
Pacific
.
Now
it
is
notorious
that
land
shells
are
easily
killed
by
sea
water
;
their
eggs
,
at
least
such
as
I
have
tried
,
sink
in
it
and
are
killed
.
Yet
there
must
be
some
unknown
,
but
occasionally
efficient
means
for
their
transportal
.
Would
the
just
hatched
young
sometimes
adhere
to
the
feet
of
birds
roosting
on
the
ground
,
and
thus
get
transported
?
It
occurred
to
me
that
landshells
,
when
hibernating
and
having
a
membranous
diaphragm
over
the
mouth
of
the
shell
,
might
be
floated
in
chinks
of
drifted
timber
across
moderately
wide
arms
of
the
sea
.
And
I
find
that
several
species
in
this
state
withstand
uninjured
an
immersion
in
sea
water
during
seven
days
:
one
shell
,
the
Helix
pomatia
,
after
having
been
thus
treated
and
again
hibernating
was
put
into
sea
water
for
twenty
days
,
and
perfectly
recovered
.
During
this
length
of
time
the
shell
might
have
been
carried
by
a
marine
current
of
average
swiftness
,
to
a
distance
of
660
geographical
miles
.
As
this
Helix
has
a
thick
calcareous
operculum
,
I
removed
it
,
and
when
it
had
formed
a
new
membranous
one
,
I
again
immersed
it
for
fourteen
days
in
sea
water
,
and
again
it
recovered
and
crawled
away
.
Baron
Aucapitaine
has
since
tried
similar
experiments
:
he
placed
100
landshells
,
belonging
to
ten
species
,
in
a
box
pierced
with
holes
,
and
immersed
it
for
a
fortnight
in
the
sea
.
Out
of
the
hundred
shells
,
twenty
seven
recovered
.
The
presence
of
an
operculum
seems
to
have
been
of
importance
,
as
out
of
twelve
specimens
of
Cyclostoma
elegans
,
which
is
thus
furnished
,
eleven
revived
.
It
is
remarkable
,
seeing
how
well
the
Helix
pomatia
resisted
with
me
the
salt
water
,
that
not
one
of
fifty
four
specimens
belonging
to
four
other
species
of
Helix
tried
by
Aucapitaine
,
recovered
.
It
is
,
however
,
not
at
all
probable
that
land
shells
have
often
been
thus
transported
;
the
feet
of
birds
offer
a
more
probable
method
.
On
the
Relations
of
the
Inhabitants
of
Islands
to
those
of
the
nearest
Mainland
The
most
striking
and
important
fact
for
us
is
the
affinity
of
the
species
which
inhabit
islands
to
those
of
the
nearest
mainland
,
without
being
actually
the
same
.
Numerous
instances
could
be
given
.
The
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
situated
under
the
equator
,
lies
at
the
distance
of
between
500
and
600
miles
from
the
shores
of
South
America
.
Here
almost
every
product
of
the
land
and
of
the
water
bears
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
the
American
continent
.
There
are
twenty
six
land
birds
;
of
these
,
twenty
one
,
or
perhaps
twenty
three
are
ranked
as
distinct
species
,
and
would
commonly
be
assumed
to
have
been
here
created
;
yet
the
close
affinity
of
most
of
these
birds
to
American
species
is
manifest
in
every
character
,
in
their
habits
,
gestures
,
and
tones
of
voice
.
So
it
is
with
the
other
animals
,
and
with
a
large
proportion
of
the
plants
,
as
shown
by
Dr
.
Hooker
in
his
admirable
Flora
of
this
archipelago
.
The
naturalist
,
looking
at
the
inhabitants
of
these
volcanic
islands
in
the
Pacific
,
distant
several
hundred
miles
from
the
continent
,
feels
that
he
is
standing
on
American
land
.
Why
should
this
be
so
?
Why
should
the
species
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
created
in
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
and
nowhere
else
,
bear
so
plainly
the
stamp
of
affinity
to
those
created
in
America
?
There
is
nothing
in
the
conditions
of
life
,
in
the
geological
nature
of
the
islands
,
in
their
height
or
climate
,
or
in
the
proportions
in
which
the
several
classes
are
associated
together
,
which
closely
resemble
;
the
conditions
of
the
South
American
coast
:
in
fact
,
there
is
a
considerable
dissimilarity
in
all
these
respects
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
a
considerable
degree
of
resemblance
in
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
soil
,
in
the
climate
,
height
,
and
size
of
the
islands
,
between
the
Galapagos
and
Cape
Verde
Archipelagoes
:
but
what
an
entire
and
absolute
difference
in
their
inhabitants!
The
inhabitants
of
the
Cape
Verde
Islands
are
related
to
those
of
Africa
,
like
those
of
the
Galapagos
to
America
.
Facts
such
as
these
admit
of
no
sort
of
explanation
on
the
ordinary
view
of
independent
creation
;
whereas
on
the
view
here
maintained
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
Galapagos
Islands
would
be
likely
to
receive
colonists
from
America
,
whether
by
occasional
means
of
transport
or
(
though
I
do
not
believe
in
this
doctrine
)
by
formerly
continuous
land
,
and
the
Cape
Verde
Islands
from
Africa
;
such
colonists
would
be
liable
to
modification
,
the
principle
of
inheritance
still
betraying
their
original
birthplace
.
Many
analogous
facts
could
be
given
:
indeed
it
is
an
almost
universal
rule
that
the
endemic
productions
of
islands
are
related
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
,
or
of
the
nearest
large
island
.
The
exceptions
are
few
,
and
most
of
them
can
be
explained
.
Thus
although
Kerguelen
Land
stands
nearer
to
Africa
than
to
America
,
the
plants
are
related
,
and
that
very
closely
,
as
we
know
from
Dr
.
Hooker's
account
,
to
those
of
America
:
but
on
the
view
that
this
island
has
been
mainly
stocked
by
seeds
brought
with
earth
and
stones
on
icebergs
,
drifted
by
the
prevailing
currents
,
this
anomaly
disappears
.
New
Zealand
in
its
endemic
planes
is
much
more
closely
related
to
Australia
,
the
nearest
mainland
,
than
to
any
other
region
:
and
this
is
what
might
have
been
expected
;
but
it
is
also
plainly
related
to
South
America
,
which
,
although
the
next
nearest
continent
,
is
so
enormously
remote
,
that
the
fact
becomes
an
anomaly
.
But
this
difficulty
partially
disappears
on
the
view
that
New
Zealand
,
South
America
,
and
the
other
southern
lands
have
been
stocked
in
part
from
a
nearly
intermediate
though
distant
point
,
namely
from
the
antarctic
islands
,
when
they
were
clothed
with
vegetation
,
during
a
warmer
tertiary
period
,
before
the
commencement
of
the
last
Glacial
period
.
The
affinity
,
which
though
feeble
,
I
am
assured
by
Dr
.
Hooker
is
real
,
between
the
flora
of
the
south
western
corner
of
Australia
and
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
is
a
far
more
remarkable
case
;
but
this
affinity
is
confined
to
the
plants
,
and
will
,
no
doubt
,
some
day
be
explained
.
The
same
law
which
has
determined
the
relationship
between
the
inhabitants
of
islands
and
the
nearest
mainland
,
is
sometimes
displayed
on
a
small
scale
,
but
in
a
most
interesting
manner
,
within
the
limits
of
the
same
archipelago
.
Thus
each
separate
island
of
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
is
tenanted
,
and
the
fact
is
a
marvellous
one
,
by
many
different
species
;
but
these
species
are
related
to
each
other
in
a
very
much
closer
manner
than
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
American
continent
,
or
of
any
other
quarter
of
the
world
.
This
is
what
might
have
been
expected
,
for
islands
situated
so
near
to
each
other
would
almost
necessarily
receive
immigrants
from
the
same
original
source
,
and
from
each
other
.
But
how
is
it
that
many
of
the
immigrants
have
been
differently
modified
,
though
only
in
a
small
degree
,
in
islands
situated
within
sight
of
each
other
,
having
the
same
geological
nature
,
the
same
height
,
climate
,
&c
.
?
This
long
appeared
to
me
a
great
difficulty
:
but
it
arises
in
chief
part
from
the
deeply
seated
error
of
considering
the
physical
conditions
of
a
country
as
the
most
important
;
whereas
it
cannot
be
disputed
that
the
nature
of
the
other
species
with
which
each
has
to
compete
,
is
at
least
as
important
,
and
generally
a
far
more
important
element
of
success
.
Now
if
we
look
to
the
species
which
inhabit
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
and
are
likewise
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
,
we
find
that
they
differ
considerably
in
the
several
islands
.
This
difference
might
indeed
have
been
expected
if
the
islands
had
been
stocked
by
occasional
means
of
transport
a
seed
,
for
instance
,
of
one
plant
having
been
brought
to
one
island
,
and
that
of
another
plant
to
another
island
,
though
all
proceeding
from
the
same
general
source
.
Hence
,
when
in
former
times
an
immigrant
first
settled
on
one
of
the
islands
,
or
when
it
subsequently
spread
from
one
to
another
,
it
would
undoubtedly
be
exposed
to
different
conditions
in
the
different
islands
,
for
it
would
have
to
compete
with
a
different
set
of
organisms
;
a
plant
,
for
instance
,
would
find
the
ground
best
fitted
for
it
occupied
by
somewhat
different
species
in
the
different
islands
,
and
would
be
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
somewhat
different
enemies
.
If
then
it
varied
,
natural
selection
would
probably
favour
different
varieties
in
the
different
islands
.
Some
species
,
however
,
might
spread
and
yet
retain
the
same
character
throughout
the
group
,
just
as
we
see
some
species
spreading
widely
throughout
a
continent
and
remaining
the
same
.
The
really
surprising
fact
in
this
case
of
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
some
analogous
cases
,
is
that
each
new
species
after
being
formed
in
any
one
island
,
did
not
spread
quickly
to
the
other
islands
.
But
the
islands
,
though
in
sight
of
each
other
,
are
separated
by
deep
arms
of
the
sea
,
in
most
cases
wider
than
the
British
Channel
,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have
at
any
former
period
been
continuously
united
.
The
currents
of
the
sea
are
rapid
and
sweep
between
the
islands
,
and
gales
of
wind
are
extraordinarily
rare
;
so
that
the
islands
are
far
more
effectually
separated
from
each
other
than
they
appear
on
a
map
.
Nevertheless
some
of
the
species
,
both
of
those
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
of
those
confined
to
the
archipelago
,
are
common
to
the
several
islands
;
and
we
may
infer
from
their
present
manner
of
distribution
,
that
they
have
spread
from
one
island
to
the
others
.
But
we
often
take
,
I
think
,
an
erroneous
view
of
the
probability
of
closely
allied
species
invading
each
other's
territory
,
when
put
into
free
intercommunication
.
Undoubtedly
,
if
one
species
has
any
advantage
over
another
,
it
will
in
a
very
brief
time
wholly
or
in
part
supplant
it
;
but
if
both
are
equally
well
fitted
for
their
own
places
,
both
will
probably
hold
their
separate
places
for
almost
any
length
of
time
.
Being
familiar
with
the
fact
that
many
species
,
naturalised
through
man's
agency
,
have
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
over
wide
areas
,
we
are
apt
to
infer
that
most
species
would
thus
spread
;
but
we
should
remember
that
the
species
which
become
naturalised
in
new
countries
are
not
generally
closely
allied
to
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
,
but
are
very
distinct
forms
,
belonging
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
,
as
shown
by
Alph
.
de
Candolle
,
to
distinct
genera
.
In
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
many
even
of
the
birds
,
though
so
well
adapted
for
flying
from
island
to
island
,
differ
on
the
different
islands
;
thus
there
are
three
closely
allied
species
of
mocking
thrush
,
each
confined
to
its
own
island
.
Now
let
us
suppose
the
mocking
thrush
of
Chatham
Island
to
be
blown
to
Charles
Island
,
which
has
its
own
mocking
thrush
,
why
should
it
succeed
in
establishing
itself
there
?
We
may
safely
infer
that
Charles
Island
is
well
stocked
with
its
own
species
,
for
annually
more
eggs
are
laid
and
young
birds
hatched
,
than
can
possibly
be
reared
;
and
we
may
infer
that
the
mocking
thrush
peculiar
to
Charles's
Island
is
at
least
as
well
fitted
for
its
home
as
is
the
species
peculiar
to
Chatham
Island
.
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
Mr
.
Wollaston
have
communicated
to
me
a
remarkable
fact
bearing
on
this
subject
;
namely
,
that
Madeira
and
the
adjoining
islet
of
Porto
Santo
possess
many
distinct
but
representative
species
of
land
shells
,
some
of
which
live
in
crevices
of
stone
;
and
although
large
quantities
of
stone
are
annually
transported
from
Porto
Santo
to
Madeira
,
yet
this
latter
island
has
not
become
colonised
by
the
Porto
Santo
species
;
nevertheless
both
islands
have
been
colonised
by
European
land
shells
,
which
no
doubt
had
some
advantage
over
the
indigenous
species
.
From
these
considerations
I
think
we
need
not
greatly
marvel
at
the
endemic
species
which
inhabit
the
several
islands
of
the
Galapagos
Archipelago
,
not
having
all
spread
from
island
to
island
.
On
the
same
continent
,
also
,
preoccupation
has
probably
played
an
important
part
in
checking
the
commingling
of
the
species
which
inhabit
different
districts
with
nearly
the
same
physical
conditions
.
Thus
,
the
south
east
and
south
west
corners
of
Australia
have
nearly
the
same
physical
conditions
,
and
are
united
by
continuous
land
,
yet
they
are
inhabited
by
a
vast
number
of
distinct
mammals
,
birds
,
and
plants
;
so
it
is
,
according
to
Mr
.
Bates
,
with
the
butterflies
and
other
animals
inhabiting
the
great
,
open
,
and
continuous
valley
of
the
Amazons
.
The
same
principle
which
governs
the
general
character
of
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
,
namely
,
the
relation
to
the
source
whence
colonists
could
have
been
most
easily
derived
,
together
with
their
subsequent
modification
,
is
of
the
widest
application
throughout
nature
.
We
see
this
on
every
mountain
summit
,
in
every
lake
and
marsh
.
For
Alpine
species
,
excepting
in
as
far
as
the
same
species
have
become
widely
spread
during
the
Glacial
epoch
,
are
related
to
those
of
the
surrounding
lowlands
;
thus
we
have
in
South
America
,
Alpine
humming
birds
,
Alpine
rodents
,
Alpine
plants
,
&c
.
,
all
strictly
belonging
to
American
forms
;
and
it
is
obvious
that
a
mountain
,
as
it
became
slowly
unheaved
,
would
be
colonised
from
the
surrounding
lowlands
.
So
it
is
with
the
inhabitants
of
lakes
and
marshes
,
excepting
in
so
far
as
great
facility
of
transport
has
allowed
the
same
forms
to
prevail
throughout
large
portions
of
the
world
.
We
see
this
same
principle
in
the
character
of
most
of
the
blind
animals
inhabiting
the
caves
of
America
and
of
Europe
.
Other
analogous
facts
could
be
given
.
It
will
,
I
believe
,
be
found
universally
true
,
that
wherever
in
two
regions
,
let
them
be
ever
so
distant
,
many
closely
allied
or
representative
species
occur
,
there
will
likewise
be
found
some
identical
species
;
and
wherever
many
closely
allied
species
occur
,
there
will
be
found
many
forms
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
distinct
species
,
and
others
as
mere
varieties
;
these
doubtful
forms
showing
us
the
steps
in
the
progress
of
modification
.
The
relation
between
the
power
and
extent
of
migration
in
certain
species
,
either
at
the
present
or
at
some
former
period
,
and
the
existence
at
remote
points
of
the
world
of
closely
allied
species
,
is
shown
in
another
and
more
general
way
.
Mr
.
Gould
remarked
to
me
long
ago
,
that
in
those
genera
of
birds
which
range
over
the
world
,
many
of
the
species
have
very
wide
ranges
.
I
can
hardly
doubt
that
this
rule
is
generally
true
,
though
difficult
of
proof
.
Amongst
mammals
,
we
see
it
strikingly
displayed
in
bats
,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
the
Felidae
and
Canidae
.
We
see
the
same
rule
in
the
distribution
of
butterflies
and
beetles
.
So
it
is
with
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
fresh
water
,
for
many
of
the
genera
in
the
most
distinct
classes
range
over
the
world
,
and
many
of
the
species
have
enormous
ranges
.
It
is
not
meant
that
all
,
but
that
some
of
the
species
have
very
wide
ranges
in
the
genera
which
range
very
widely
.
Nor
is
it
meant
that
the
species
in
such
genera
have
on
an
average
a
very
wide
range
;
for
this
will
largely
depend
on
how
far
the
process
of
modification
has
gone
;
for
instance
,
two
varieties
of
the
same
species
inhabit
America
and
Europe
,
and
thus
the
species
has
an
immense
range
;
but
,
if
variation
were
to
be
carried
a
little
further
,
the
two
varieties
would
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
,
and
their
range
would
be
greatly
reduced
.
Still
less
is
it
meant
,
that
species
which
have
the
capacity
of
crossing
barriers
and
ranging
widely
,
as
in
the
case
of
certain
powerfully
winged
birds
,
will
necessarily
range
widely
;
for
we
should
never
forget
that
to
range
widely
implies
not
only
the
power
of
crossing
barriers
,
but
the
more
important
power
of
being
victorious
in
distant
lands
in
the
struggle
for
life
with
foreign
associates
.
But
according
to
the
view
that
all
the
species
of
a
genus
,
though
distributed
to
the
most
remote
points
of
the
world
,
are
descended
from
a
single
progenitor
,
we
ought
to
find
,
and
I
believe
as
a
general
rule
we
do
find
,
that
some
at
least
of
the
species
range
very
widely
.
We
should
bear
in
mind
that
many
genera
in
all
classes
are
of
ancient
origin
,
and
the
species
in
this
case
will
have
had
ample
time
for
dispersal
and
subsequent
modification
.
There
is
also
reason
to
believe
from
geological
evidence
,
that
within
each
great
class
the
lower
organisms
change
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
higher
;
consequently
they
will
have
had
a
better
chance
of
ranging
widely
and
of
still
retaining
the
same
specific
character
.
This
fact
,
together
with
that
of
the
seeds
and
eggs
of
most
lowly
organised
forms
being
very
minute
and
better
fitted
for
distant
transportal
,
probably
accounts
for
a
law
which
has
long
been
observed
,
and
which
has
lately
been
discussed
by
Alph
.
de
Candolle
in
regard
to
plants
,
namely
,
that
the
lower
any
group
of
organisms
stands
the
more
widely
it
ranges
.
The
relations
just
discussed
,
namely
,
lower
organisms
ranging
more
widely
than
the
higher
,
some
of
the
species
of
widely
ranging
genera
themselves
ranging
widely
,
such
facts
,
as
Alpine
,
lacustrine
,
and
marsh
productions
being
generally
related
to
those
which
live
on
the
surrounding
low
lands
and
dry
lands
,
the
striking
relationship
between
the
inhabitants
of
islands
and
those
of
the
nearest
mainland
,
the
still
closer
relationship
of
the
distinct
inhabitants
of
the
islands
in
the
same
archipelago
,
are
inexplicable
on
the
ordinary
view
of
the
independent
creation
of
each
species
,
but
are
explicable
if
we
admit
colonisation
from
the
nearest
or
readiest
source
,
together
with
the
subsequent
adaptation
of
the
colonists
to
their
new
homes
.
Summary
of
the
last
and
present
Chapters
In
these
chapters
I
have
endeavoured
to
show
,
that
if
we
make
due
allowance
for
our
ignorance
of
the
full
effects
of
changes
of
climate
and
of
the
level
of
the
land
,
which
have
certainly
occurred
within
the
recent
period
,
and
of
other
changes
which
have
probably
occurred
,
if
we
remember
how
ignorant
we
are
with
respect
to
the
many
curious
means
of
occasional
transport
,
if
we
bear
in
mind
,
and
this
is
a
very
important
consideration
,
how
often
a
species
may
have
ranged
continuously
over
a
wide
area
,
and
then
have
become
extinct
in
the
intermediate
tracts
,
the
difficulty
is
not
insuperable
in
believing
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
wherever
found
,
are
descended
from
common
parents
.
And
we
are
led
to
this
conclusion
,
which
has
been
arrived
at
by
many
naturalists
under
the
designation
of
single
centres
of
creation
,
by
various
general
considerations
,
more
especially
from
the
importance
of
barriers
of
all
kinds
,
and
from
the
analogical
distribution
of
subgenera
,
genera
,
and
families
.
With
respect
to
distinct
species
belonging
to
the
same
genus
,
which
on
our
theory
have
spread
from
one
parent
source
;
if
we
make
the
same
allowances
as
before
for
our
ignorance
,
and
remember
that
some
forms
of
life
have
changed
very
slowly
,
enormous
periods
of
time
having
been
thus
granted
for
their
migration
,
the
difficulties
are
far
from
insuperable
;
though
in
this
case
,
as
in
that
of
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
they
are
often
great
.
As
exemplifying
the
effects
of
climatal
changes
on
distribution
,
I
have
attempted
to
show
how
important
a
part
the
last
Glacial
period
has
played
,
which
affected
even
the
equatorial
regions
,
and
which
,
during
the
alternations
of
the
cold
in
the
north
and
south
,
allowed
the
productions
of
opposite
hemispheres
to
mingle
,
and
left
some
of
them
stranded
on
the
mountain
summits
in
all
parts
of
the
world
.
As
showing
how
diversified
are
the
means
of
occasional
transport
,
I
have
discussed
at
some
little
length
the
means
of
dispersal
of
fresh
water
productions
.
If
the
difficulties
be
not
insuperable
in
admitting
that
in
the
long
course
of
time
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
likewise
of
the
several
species
belonging
to
the
same
genus
,
have
proceeded
from
some
one
source
;
then
all
the
grand
leading
facts
of
geographical
distribution
are
explicable
on
the
theory
of
migration
,
together
with
subsequent
modification
and
the
multiplication
of
new
forms
.
We
can
thus
understand
the
high
importance
of
barriers
,
whether
of
land
or
water
,
in
not
only
separating
,
but
in
apparently
forming
the
several
zoological
and
botanical
provinces
.
We
can
thus
understand
the
concentration
of
related
species
within
the
same
areas
;
and
how
it
is
that
under
different
latitudes
,
for
instance
in
South
America
,
the
inhabitants
of
the
plains
and
mountains
,
of
the
forests
,
marshes
,
and
deserts
,
are
linked
together
in
so
mysterious
a
manner
,
and
are
likewise
linked
to
the
extinct
beings
which
formerly
inhabited
the
same
continent
.
Bearing
in
mind
that
the
mutual
relation
of
organism
to
organism
is
of
the
highest
importance
,
we
can
see
why
two
areas
having
nearly
the
same
physical
conditions
should
often
be
inhabited
by
very
different
forms
of
life
;
for
according
to
the
length
of
time
which
has
elapsed
since
the
colonists
entered
one
of
the
regions
,
or
both
;
according
to
the
nature
of
the
communication
which
allowed
certain
forms
and
not
others
to
enter
,
either
in
greater
or
lesser
numbers
;
according
or
not
,
as
those
which
entered
happened
to
come
into
more
or
less
direct
competition
with
each
other
and
with
the
aborigines
;
and
according
as
the
immigrants
were
capable
of
varying
more
or
less
rapidly
,
there
would
ensue
in
the
two
or
more
regions
,
independently
of
their
physical
conditions
,
infinitely
diversified
conditions
of
life
,
there
would
be
an
almost
endless
amount
of
organic
action
and
reaction
,
and
we
should
find
some
groups
of
beings
greatly
,
and
some
only
slightly
modified
,
some
developed
in
great
force
,
some
existing
in
scanty
numbers
and
this
we
do
find
in
the
several
great
geographical
provinces
of
the
world
.
On
these
same
principles
we
can
understand
,
as
I
have
endeavoured
to
show
,
why
oceanic
islands
should
have
few
inhabitants
,
but
that
of
these
,
a
large
proportion
should
be
endemic
or
peculiar
;
and
why
,
in
relation
to
the
means
of
migration
,
one
group
of
beings
should
have
all
its
species
peculiar
,
and
another
group
,
even
within
the
same
class
,
should
have
all
its
species
the
same
with
those
in
an
adjoining
quarter
of
the
world
.
We
can
see
why
whole
groups
of
organisms
,
as
batrachians
and
terrestrial
mammals
,
should
be
absent
from
oceanic
islands
,
whilst
the
most
isolated
islands
should
possess
their
own
peculiar
species
of
aerial
mammals
or
bats
.
We
can
see
why
,
in
islands
,
there
should
be
some
relation
between
the
presence
of
mammals
,
in
a
more
or
less
modified
condition
,
and
the
depth
of
the
sea
between
such
islands
and
the
mainland
.
We
can
clearly
see
why
all
the
inhabitants
of
an
archipelago
,
though
specifically
distinct
on
the
several
islets
,
should
be
closely
related
to
each
other
;
and
should
likewise
be
related
,
but
less
closely
,
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
,
or
other
source
whence
immigrants
might
have
been
derived
.
We
can
see
why
,
if
there
exists
very
closely
allied
or
representative
species
in
two
areas
,
however
distant
from
each
other
,
some
identical
species
will
almost
always
there
be
found
.
As
the
late
Edward
Forbes
often
insisted
,
there
is
a
striking
parallelism
in
the
laws
of
life
throughout
time
and
space
;
the
laws
governing
the
succession
of
forms
in
past
times
being
nearly
the
same
with
those
governing
at
the
present
time
the
differences
in
different
areas
.
We
see
this
in
many
facts
.
The
endurance
of
each
species
and
group
of
species
is
continuous
in
time
;
for
the
apparent
exceptions
to
the
rule
are
so
few
,
that
they
may
fairly
be
attributed
to
our
not
having
as
yet
discovered
in
an
intermediate
deposit
certain
forms
which
are
absent
in
it
,
but
which
occur
both
above
and
below
:
so
in
space
,
it
certainly
is
the
general
rule
that
the
area
inhabited
by
a
single
species
,
or
by
a
group
of
species
,
is
continuous
,
and
the
exceptions
,
which
are
not
rare
,
may
,
as
I
have
attempted
to
show
,
be
accounted
for
by
former
migrations
under
different
circumstances
,
or
through
occasional
means
of
transport
,
or
by
the
species
having
become
extinct
in
the
intermediate
tracts
.
Both
in
time
and
space
species
and
groups
of
species
have
their
points
of
maximum
development
.
Groups
of
species
,
living
during
the
same
period
of
time
,
or
living
within
the
same
area
,
are
often
characterised
by
trifling
features
in
common
,
as
of
sculpture
or
colour
.
In
looking
to
the
long
succession
of
past
ages
,
as
in
looking
to
distant
provinces
throughout
the
world
,
we
find
that
species
in
certain
classes
differ
little
from
each
other
,
whilst
those
in
another
class
,
or
only
in
a
different
section
of
the
same
order
,
differ
greatly
from
each
other
.
In
both
time
and
space
the
lowly
organised
members
of
each
class
generally
change
less
than
the
highly
organised
;
but
there
are
in
both
cases
marked
exceptions
to
the
rule
.
According
to
our
theory
,
these
several
relations
throughout
time
and
space
are
intelligible
;
for
whether
we
look
to
the
allied
forms
of
life
which
have
changed
during
successive
ages
,
or
to
those
which
have
changed
after
having
migrated
into
distant
quarters
,
in
both
cases
they
are
connected
by
the
same
bond
of
ordinary
generation
;
in
both
cases
the
laws
of
variation
have
been
the
same
,
and
modifications
have
been
accumulated
by
the
same
means
of
natural
selection
.
CHAPTER
XIV
MUTUAL
AFFINITIES
OF
ORGANIC
BEINGS
:
MORPHOLOGY
:
EMBRYOLOGY
:
RUDIMENTARY
ORGANS
Classification
FROM
the
most
remote
period
in
the
history
of
the
world
organic
beings
have
been
found
to
resemble
each
other
in
descending
degrees
,
so
that
they
can
be
classed
in
groups
under
groups
.
This
classification
is
not
arbitrary
like
the
grouping
of
the
stars
in
constellations
.
The
existence
of
groups
would
have
been
of
simpler
significance
,
if
one
group
had
been
exclusively
fitted
to
inhabit
the
land
and
another
the
water
;
one
to
feed
on
flesh
,
another
on
vegetable
matter
,
and
so
on
;
but
the
case
is
widely
different
,
for
it
is
notorious
how
commonly
members
of
even
the
same
subgroup
have
different
habits
.
In
the
second
and
fourth
chapters
,
on
Variation
and
on
Natural
Selection
,
I
have
attempted
to
show
that
within
each
country
it
is
the
widely
ranging
,
the
much
diffused
and
common
,
that
is
the
dominant
species
,
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
in
each
class
,
which
vary
most
.
The
varieties
,
or
incipient
species
,
thus
produced
,
ultimately
become
converted
into
new
and
distinct
species
;
and
these
,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
,
tend
to
produce
other
new
and
dominant
species
.
Consequently
the
groups
which
are
now
large
,
and
which
generally
include
many
dominant
species
,
tend
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
.
I
further
attempted
to
show
that
from
the
varying
descendants
of
each
species
trying
to
occupy
as
many
and
as
different
places
as
possible
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
they
constantly
tend
to
diverge
in
character
.
This
latter
conclusion
is
supported
by
observing
the
great
diversity
of
forms
which
,
in
any
small
area
,
come
into
the
closest
competition
,
and
by
certain
facts
in
naturalisation
.
I
attempted
also
to
show
that
there
is
a
steady
tendency
in
the
forms
which
are
increasing
in
number
and
diverging
in
character
,
to
supplant
and
exterminate
the
preceding
,
less
divergent
and
less
improved
forms
.
I
request
the
reader
to
turn
to
the
diagram
illustrating
the
action
,
as
formerly
explained
,
of
these
several
principles
;
and
he
will
see
that
the
inevitable
result
is
,
that
the
modified
descendants
proceeding
from
one
progenitor
become
broken
up
into
groups
subordinate
to
groups
.
In
the
diagram
each
letter
on
the
uppermost
line
may
represent
a
genus
including
several
species
,
and
the
whole
of
the
genera
along
this
upper
line
form
together
one
class
,
for
all
are
descended
from
one
ancient
parent
,
and
,
consequently
,
have
inherited
something
in
common
.
But
the
three
genera
on
the
left
hand
have
,
on
this
same
principle
,
much
in
common
,
and
form
a
sub
family
,
distinct
from
that
containing
the
next
two
genera
on
the
right
hand
,
which
diverged
from
a
common
parent
at
the
fifth
stage
of
descent
.
These
five
genera
have
also
much
in
common
,
though
less
than
when
grouped
in
sub
families
;
and
they
form
a
family
distinct
from
that
containing
the
three
genera
still
farther
to
the
right
hand
,
which
diverged
at
an
earlier
period
.
And
all
these
genera
,
descended
from
(
A
)
,
form
an
order
distinct
from
the
genera
descended
from
(
I
)
.
So
that
we
here
have
many
species
descended
from
a
single
progenitor
grouped
into
genera
;
and
the
genera
into
sub
families
,
families
,
and
orders
,
all
under
one
great
class
.
The
grand
fact
of
the
natural
subordination
of
organic
beings
in
groups
under
groups
,
which
,
from
its
familiarity
,
does
not
always
sufficiently
strike
us
,
is
in
my
judgment
thus
explained
.
No
doubt
organic
beings
,
like
all
other
objects
,
can
be
classed
in
many
ways
,
either
artificially
by
single
characters
,
or
more
naturally
by
a
number
of
characters
.
We
know
,
for
instance
,
that
minerals
and
the
elemental
substances
can
be
thus
arranged
.
In
this
case
there
is
of
course
no
relation
to
genealogical
succession
,
and
no
cause
can
at
present
be
assigned
for
their
falling
into
groups
.
But
with
organic
beings
the
case
is
different
,
and
the
view
above
given
accords
with
their
natural
arrangement
in
group
under
group
;
and
no
other
explanation
has
ever
been
attempted
.
Naturalists
,
as
we
have
seen
,
try
to
arrange
the
species
,
genera
,
and
families
in
each
class
,
on
what
is
called
the
Natural
System
.
But
what
is
meant
by
this
system
?
Some
authors
look
at
it
merely
as
a
scheme
for
arranging
together
those
living
objects
which
are
most
alike
,
and
for
separating
those
which
are
most
unlike
;
or
as
an
artificial
method
of
enunciating
,
as
briefly
as
possible
,
general
propositions
,
that
is
,
by
one
sentence
to
give
the
characters
common
,
for
instance
,
to
all
mammals
,
by
another
those
common
to
all
carnivora
,
by
another
those
common
to
the
dog
genus
,
and
then
,
by
adding
a
single
sentence
,
a
full
description
is
given
of
each
kind
of
dog
.
The
ingenuity
and
utility
of
this
system
are
indisputable
.
But
many
naturalists
think
that
something
more
is
meant
by
the
Natural
System
;
they
believe
that
it
reveals
the
plan
of
the
Creator
;
but
unless
it
be
specified
whether
order
in
time
or
space
,
or
both
,
or
what
else
is
meant
by
the
plan
of
the
Creator
,
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
is
thus
added
to
our
knowledge
.
Expressions
such
as
that
famous
one
by
Linnaeus
,
which
we
often
meet
with
in
a
more
or
less
concealed
form
,
namely
,
that
the
characters
do
not
make
the
genus
,
but
that
the
genus
gives
the
characters
,
seem
to
imply
that
some
deeper
bond
is
included
in
our
classifications
than
mere
resemblance
.
I
believe
that
this
is
the
case
,
and
that
community
of
descent
the
one
known
cause
of
close
similarity
in
organic
beings
is
the
bond
,
which
though
observed
by
various
degrees
of
modification
,
is
partially
revealed
to
us
by
our
classifications
.
Let
us
now
consider
the
rules
followed
in
classification
,
and
the
difficulties
which
are
encountered
on
the
view
that
classification
either
gives
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
,
or
is
simply
a
scheme
for
enunciating
general
propositions
and
of
placing
together
the
forms
most
like
each
other
.
It
might
have
been
thought
(
and
was
in
ancient
times
thought
)
that
those
parts
of
the
structure
which
determined
the
habits
of
life
,
and
the
general
place
of
each
being
in
the
economy
of
nature
,
would
be
of
very
high
importance
in
classification
.
Nothing
can
be
more
false
.
No
one
regards
the
external
similarity
of
a
mouse
to
a
shrew
,
of
a
dugong
to
a
whale
,
of
a
whale
to
a
fish
,
as
of
any
importance
.
These
resemblances
,
though
so
intimately
connected
with
the
whole
life
of
the
being
,
are
ranked
as
merely
"
adaptive
or
analogical
characters
"
;
but
to
the
consideration
of
these
resemblances
we
shall
recur
.
It
may
even
be
given
as
a
general
rule
,
that
the
less
any
part
of
the
organisation
is
concerned
with
special
habits
,
the
more
important
it
becomes
for
classification
.
As
an
instance
:
Owen
,
in
speaking
of
the
dugong
,
says
,
"
The
generative
organs
,
being
those
which
are
most
remotely
related
to
the
habits
and
food
of
an
animal
,
I
have
always
regarded
as
affording
very
clear
indications
of
its
true
affinities
.
We
are
least
likely
in
the
modifications
of
these
organs
to
mistake
a
merely
adaptive
for
an
essential
character
.
"
With
plants
how
remarkable
it
is
that
the
organs
of
vegetation
,
on
which
their
nutrition
and
life
depend
,
are
of
little
significance
;
whereas
the
organs
of
reproduction
,
with
their
product
the
seed
and
embryo
,
are
of
paramount
importance!
So
again
in
formerly
discussing
certain
morphological
characters
which
are
not
functionally
important
,
we
have
seen
that
they
are
often
of
the
highest
service
in
classification
.
This
depends
on
their
constancy
throughout
many
allied
groups
;
and
their
constancy
chiefly
depends
on
any
slight
deviations
not
having
been
preserved
and
accumulated
by
natural
selection
,
which
acts
only
on
serviceable
characters
.
That
the
mere
physiological
importance
of
an
organ
does
not
determine
its
classificatory
value
,
is
almost
proved
by
the
fact
that
in
allied
groups
,
in
which
the
same
organ
,
as
we
have
every
reason
to
suppose
,
has
nearly
the
same
physiological
value
,
its
classificatory
value
is
widely
different
.
No
naturalist
can
have
worked
long
at
any
group
without
being
struck
with
this
fact
;
and
it
has
been
fully
acknowledged
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
author
.
It
will
suffice
to
quote
the
highest
authority
,
Robert
Brown
,
who
,
in
speaking
of
certain
organs
in
the
Proteaceae
,
says
their
generic
importance
,
"
like
that
of
all
their
parts
,
not
only
in
this
,
but
,
as
apprehend
,
in
every
natural
family
,
is
very
unequal
,
and
in
some
cases
seems
to
be
entirely
lost
.
"
Again
,
in
another
work
he
says
,
the
genera
of
the
Connaraceae
"
differ
in
having
one
or
more
ovaria
,
in
the
existence
or
absence
of
albumen
,
in
the
imbricate
or
valvular
aestivation
.
Any
one
of
these
characters
singly
is
frequently
of
more
than
generic
importance
,
though
here
even
when
all
taken
together
they
appear
insufficient
to
separate
Cnestis
from
Connarus
.
"
To
give
an
example
amongst
insects
:
in
one
great
division
of
the
Hymenoptera
,
the
antennae
,
as
Westwood
has
remarked
,
are
most
constant
in
structure
;
in
another
division
they
differ
much
,
and
the
differences
are
of
quite
subordinate
value
in
classification
;
yet
no
one
will
say
that
the
antennae
in
these
two
divisions
of
the
same
order
are
of
unequal
physiological
importance
.
Any
number
of
instances
could
be
given
of
the
varying
importance
for
classification
of
the
same
important
organ
within
the
same
group
of
beings
.
Again
,
no
one
will
say
that
rudimentary
or
atrophied
organs
are
of
high
physiological
or
vital
importance
;
yet
,
undoubtedly
,
organs
in
this
condition
are
often
of
much
value
in
classification
.
No
one
will
dispute
that
the
rudimentary
teeth
in
the
upper
jaws
of
young
ruminants
,
and
certain
rudimentary
bones
of
the
leg
,
are
highly
serviceable
in
exhibiting
the
close
affinity
between
ruminants
and
pachyderms
.
Robert
Brown
has
strongly
insisted
on
the
fact
that
the
position
of
the
rudimentary
florets
is
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
classification
of
the
grasses
.
Numerous
instances
could
be
given
of
characters
derived
from
parts
which
must
be
considered
of
very
trifling
physiological
importance
,
but
which
are
universally
admitted
as
highly
serviceable
in
the
definition
of
whole
groups
.
For
instance
,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
open
passage
from
the
nostrils
to
the
mouth
,
the
only
character
,
according
to
Owen
,
which
absolutely
distinguishes
fishes
and
reptiles
the
inflection
of
the
angle
of
the
lower
jaw
in
marsupials
the
manner
in
which
the
wings
of
insects
are
folded
mere
colour
in
certain
Algae
mere
pubescence
on
parts
of
the
flower
in
grasses
the
nature
of
the
dermal
covering
,
as
hair
or
feathers
,
in
the
Vertebrata
.
If
the
Ornithorhynchus
had
been
covered
with
feathers
instead
of
hair
,
this
external
and
trifling
character
would
have
been
considered
by
naturalists
as
an
important
aid
in
determining
the
degree
of
affinity
of
this
strange
creature
to
birds
.
The
importance
,
for
classification
,
of
trifling
characters
,
mainly
depends
on
their
being
correlated
with
many
other
characters
of
more
or
less
importance
.
The
value
indeed
of
an
aggregate
of
characters
is
very
evident
in
natural
history
.
Hence
,
as
has
often
been
remarked
,
a
species
may
depart
from
its
allies
in
several
characters
,
both
of
high
physiological
importance
,
and
of
almost
universal
prevalence
,
and
yet
leave
us
in
no
doubt
where
it
should
be
ranked
.
Hence
,
also
,
it
has
been
found
that
a
classification
founded
on
any
single
character
,
however
,
important
that
may
be
,
has
always
failed
;
for
no
part
of
the
organisation
is
invariably
constant
.
The
importance
of
an
aggregate
of
characters
,
even
when
none
are
important
,
alone
explains
the
aphorism
enunciated
by
Linnaeus
,
namely
,
that
the
characters
do
not
give
the
genus
,
but
the
genus
gives
the
characters
;
for
this
seems
founded
on
the
appreciation
of
many
trifling
points
of
resemblance
,
too
slight
to
be
defined
.
Certain
plants
,
belonging
to
the
Malpighiaceae
,
bear
perfect
and
degraded
flowers
;
in
the
latter
,
as
A
.
de
Jussieu
has
remarked
,
"
The
greater
number
of
the
characters
proper
to
the
species
,
to
the
genus
,
to
the
family
,
to
the
class
,
disappear
,
and
thus
laugh
at
our
classification
.
"
When
Aspicarpa
produced
in
France
,
during
several
years
,
only
these
degraded
flowers
,
departing
so
wonderfully
in
a
number
of
the
most
important
points
of
structure
from
the
proper
type
of
the
order
,
yet
M
.
Richard
sagaciously
saw
,
as
Jussieu
observes
,
that
this
genus
should
still
be
retained
amongst
the
Malpighiaceae
.
This
case
well
illustrates
the
spirit
of
our
classifications
.
Practically
,
when
naturalists
are
at
work
,
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
the
physiological
value
of
the
characters
which
they
use
in
defining
a
group
or
in
allocating
any
particular
species
.
If
they
find
a
character
nearly
uniform
,
and
common
to
a
great
number
of
forms
,
and
not
common
to
others
,
they
use
it
as
one
of
high
value
;
if
common
to
some
lesser
number
,
they
use
it
as
of
subordinate
value
.
This
principle
has
been
broadly
confessed
by
some
naturalists
to
be
the
true
one
;
and
by
none
more
clearly
than
by
that
excellent
botanist
,
Auguste
de
Saint
Hilaire
.
If
several
trifling
characters
are
always
found
in
combination
,
though
no
apparent
bond
of
connection
can
be
discovered
between
them
,
especial
value
is
set
on
them
.
As
in
most
groups
of
animals
,
important
organs
,
such
as
those
for
propelling
the
blood
,
or
for
Aerating
it
,
or
those
for
propagating
the
race
,
are
found
nearly
uniform
,
they
are
considered
as
highly
serviceable
in
classification
;
but
in
some
organs
all
these
,
the
most
important
vital
organs
,
are
found
to
offer
characters
of
quite
subordinate
value
.
Thus
,
as
Fritz
Muller
has
lately
remarked
,
in
the
same
group
of
crustaceans
,
Cypridina
is
furnished
with
a
heart
,
whilst
in
two
closely
allied
genera
,
namely
Cypris
and
Cytherea
,
there
is
no
such
organ
;
one
species
of
Cypridina
has
well
developed
branchiae
,
whilst
another
species
is
destitute
of
them
.
We
can
see
why
characters
derived
from
the
embryo
should
be
of
equal
importance
with
those
derived
from
the
adult
,
for
a
natural
classification
of
course
includes
all
ages
.
But
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
,
on
the
ordinary
view
,
why
the
structure
of
the
embryo
should
be
more
important
for
this
purpose
than
that
of
the
adult
,
which
alone
plays
its
full
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
.
Yet
it
has
been
strongly
urged
by
those
great
naturalists
,
Milne
Edwards
and
Agassiz
,
that
embryological
characters
are
the
most
important
of
all
;
and
this
doctrine
has
very
generally
been
admitted
as
true
.
Nevertheless
,
their
importance
has
sometimes
been
exaggerated
,
owing
to
the
adaptive
characters
of
larvae
not
having
been
excluded
;
in
order
to
show
this
,
Fritz
Muller
arranged
by
the
aid
of
such
characters
alone
the
great
class
of
crustaceans
,
and
the
arrangement
did
not
prove
a
natural
one
.
But
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
embryonic
,
excluding
larval
characters
,
are
of
the
highest
value
for
classification
,
not
only
with
animals
but
with
plants
.
Thus
the
main
divisions
of
flowering
plants
are
founded
on
differences
in
the
embryo
,
on
the
number
and
position
of
the
cotyledons
,
and
on
the
mode
of
development
of
the
plumule
and
radicle
.
We
shall
immediately
see
why
these
characters
possess
so
high
a
value
in
classification
,
namely
,
from
the
natural
system
being
genealogical
in
its
arrangement
.
Our
classifications
are
often
plainly
influenced
by
chains
of
affinities
.
Nothing
can
be
easier
than
to
define
a
number
of
characters
common
to
all
birds
;
but
with
crustaceans
,
any
such
definition
has
hitherto
been
found
impossible
.
There
are
crustaceans
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
series
,
which
have
hardly
a
character
in
common
;
yet
the
species
at
both
ends
,
from
being
plainly
allied
to
others
,
and
these
to
others
,
and
so
onwards
,
can
be
recognised
as
unequivocally
belonging
to
this
,
and
to
no
other
class
of
the
Articulata
.
Geographical
distribution
has
often
been
used
,
though
perhaps
not
quite
logically
,
in
classification
,
more
especially
in
very
large
groups
of
closely
allied
forms
.
Temminck
insists
on
the
utility
or
even
necessity
of
this
practice
in
certain
groups
of
birds
;
and
it
has
been
followed
by
several
entomologists
and
botanists
.
Finally
,
with
respect
to
the
comparative
value
of
the
various
groups
of
species
,
such
as
orders
,
sub
orders
,
families
,
sub
families
,
and
genera
,
they
seem
to
be
,
at
least
at
present
,
almost
arbitrary
.
Several
of
the
best
botanists
,
such
as
Mr
.
Bentham
and
others
,
have
strongly
insisted
on
their
arbitrary
value
.
Instances
could
be
given
amongst
plants
and
insects
,
of
a
group
first
ranked
by
practised
naturalists
as
only
a
genus
,
and
then
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
sub
family
or
family
;
and
this
has
been
done
,
not
because
further
research
has
detected
important
structural
differences
,
at
first
overlooked
,
but
because
numerous
allied
species
with
slightly
different
grades
of
difference
,
have
been
subsequently
discovered
.
All
the
foregoing
rules
and
aids
and
difficulties
in
classification
may
be
explained
,
if
I
do
not
greatly
deceive
myself
,
on
the
view
that
the
Natural
System
is
founded
on
descent
with
modification
;
that
the
characters
which
naturalists
consider
as
showing
true
affinity
between
any
two
or
more
species
,
are
those
which
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
parent
,
all
true
classification
being
genealogical
;
that
community
of
descent
is
the
hidden
bond
which
naturalists
have
been
unconsciously
seeking
,
and
not
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
,
or
the
enunciation
of
general
propositions
,
and
the
mere
putting
together
and
separating
objects
more
or
less
alike
.
But
I
must
explain
my
meaning
more
fully
.
I
believe
that
the
arrangement
of
the
groups
within
each
class
,
in
due
subordination
and
relation
to
each
other
,
must
be
strictly
genealogical
in
order
to
be
natural
;
but
that
the
amount
of
difference
in
the
several
branches
or
groups
,
though
allied
in
the
same
degree
in
blood
to
their
common
progenitor
,
may
differ
greatly
,
being
due
to
the
different
degrees
of
modification
which
they
have
undergone
;
and
this
is
expressed
by
the
forms
being
ranked
under
different
genera
,
families
,
sections
,
or
orders
.
The
reader
will
best
understand
what
is
meant
,
if
he
will
take
the
trouble
to
refer
to
the
diagram
in
the
fourth
chapter
.
We
will
suppose
the
letters
A
to
L
to
represent
allied
genera
existing
during
the
Silurian
epoch
,
and
descended
from
some
still
earlier
form
.
In
three
of
these
genera
(
A
,
F
,
and
I
)
,
a
species
has
transmitted
modified
descendants
to
the
present
day
,
represented
by
the
fifteen
genera
(
a14
to
z14
)
on
the
uppermost
horizontal
line
.
Now
all
these
modified
descendants
from
a
single
species
,
are
related
in
blood
or
descent
in
the
same
degree
;
they
may
metaphorically
be
called
cousins
to
the
same
millionth
degree
;
yet
they
differ
widely
and
in
different
degrees
from
each
other
.
The
forms
descended
from
A
,
now
broken
up
into
two
or
three
families
,
constitute
a
distinct
order
from
those
descended
from
I
,
also
broken
up
into
two
families
.
Nor
can
the
existing
species
,
descended
from
A
,
be
ranked
in
the
same
genus
with
the
parent
A
;
or
those
from
I
,
with
the
parent
I
.
But
the
existing
genus
f14
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
but
slightly
modified
;
and
it
will
then
rank
with
the
parent
genus
F
;
just
as
some
few
still
living
organisms
belong
to
Silurian
genera
.
So
that
the
comparative
value
of
the
differences
between
these
organic
beings
,
which
are
all
related
to
each
other
in
the
same
degree
in
blood
,
has
come
to
be
widely
different
.
Nevertheless
their
genealogical
arrangement
remains
strictly
true
,
not
only
at
the
present
time
,
but
at
each
successive
period
of
descent
.
All
modified
descendants
from
A
will
have
inherited
something
in
common
from
their
common
parent
,
as
will
all
the
descendants
from
I
;
so
will
it
be
with
each
subordinate
branch
of
descendants
,
at
each
successive
stage
.
If
,
however
,
we
suppose
any
descendant
of
A
,
or
of
I
,
to
have
become
so
much
modified
as
to
have
lost
all
traces
of
its
parentage
,
in
this
case
,
its
place
in
the
natural
system
will
be
lost
,
as
seems
to
have
occurred
with
some
few
existing
organisms
.
All
the
descendants
of
the
genus
F
,
along
its
whole
line
of
descent
,
are
supposed
to
have
been
but
little
modified
,
and
they
form
a
single
genus
.
But
this
genus
,
though
much
isolated
,
will
still
occupy
its
proper
intermediate
position
.
The
representation
of
the
groups
,
as
here
given
in
the
diagram
on
a
flat
surface
,
is
much
too
simple
.
The
branches
ought
to
have
diverged
in
all
directions
.
If
the
names
of
the
groups
had
been
simply
written
down
in
a
linear
series
,
the
representation
would
have
been
still
less
natural
;
and
it
is
notoriously
not
possible
to
represent
in
a
series
,
on
a
flat
surface
,
the
affinities
which
we
discover
in
nature
amongst
the
beings
of
the
same
group
.
Thus
,
the
Natural
System
is
genealogical
in
its
arrangement
,
like
a
pedigree
:
but
the
amount
of
modification
which
the
different
groups
have
undergone
has
to
be
expressed
by
ranking
them
under
different
so
called
genera
,
sub
families
,
families
,
sections
,
orders
,
and
classes
.
It
may
be
worth
while
to
illustrate
this
view
of
classification
,
by
taking
the
case
of
languages
.
If
we
possessed
a
perfect
pedigree
of
mankind
,
a
genealogical
arrangement
of
the
races
of
man
would
afford
the
best
classification
of
the
various
languages
now
spoken
throughout
the
world
;
and
if
all
extinct
languages
,
and
all
intermediate
and
slowly
changing
dialects
,
were
to
be
included
,
such
an
arrangement
would
be
the
only
possible
one
.
Yet
it
might
be
that
some
ancient
languages
had
altered
very
little
and
had
given
rise
to
few
new
languages
,
whilst
others
had
altered
much
owing
to
the
spreading
,
isolation
,
and
state
of
civilisation
of
the
several
co
descended
races
,
and
had
thus
given
rise
to
many
new
dialects
and
languages
.
The
various
degrees
of
difference
between
the
languages
of
the
same
stock
,
would
have
to
be
expressed
by
groups
subordinate
to
groups
;
but
the
proper
or
even
the
only
possible
arrangement
would
still
be
genealogical
;
and
this
would
be
strictly
natural
,
as
it
would
connect
together
all
languages
,
extinct
and
recent
,
by
the
closest
affinities
,
and
would
give
the
filiation
and
origin
of
each
tongue
.
In
confirmation
of
this
view
,
let
us
glance
at
the
classification
of
varieties
,
which
are
known
or
believed
to
be
descended
from
a
single
species
.
These
are
grouped
under
the
species
,
with
the
sub
varieties
under
the
varieties
;
and
in
some
cases
,
as
with
the
domestic
pigeon
,
with
several
other
grades
of
difference
.
Nearly
the
same
rules
are
followed
as
in
classifying
species
.
Authors
have
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
arranging
varieties
on
a
natural
instead
of
an
artificial
system
;
we
are
cautioned
,
for
instance
,
not
to
class
two
varieties
of
the
pineapple
together
,
merely
because
their
fruit
,
though
the
most
important
part
,
happens
to
be
nearly
identical
;
no
one
puts
the
Swedish
and
common
turnip
together
,
though
the
esculent
and
thickened
stems
are
so
similar
.
Whatever
part
is
found
to
be
most
constant
,
is
used
in
classing
varieties
:
thus
the
great
agriculturist
Marshall
says
the
horns
are
very
useful
for
this
purpose
with
cattle
,
because
they
are
less
variable
than
the
shape
or
colour
of
the
body
,
&c
.
;
whereas
with
sheep
the
horns
are
much
less
serviceable
,
because
less
constant
.
In
classing
varieties
,
I
apprehend
that
if
we
had
a
real
pedigree
,
a
genealogical
classification
would
be
universally
preferred
;
and
it
has
been
attempted
in
some
cases
.
For
we
might
feel
sure
,
whether
there
had
been
more
or
less
modification
,
that
the
principle
of
inheritance
would
keep
the
forms
together
which
were
allied
in
the
greatest
number
of
points
.
In
tumbler
pigeons
,
though
some
of
the
sub
varieties
differ
in
the
important
character
of
the
length
of
the
beak
,
yet
all
are
kept
together
from
having
the
common
habit
of
tumbling
;
but
the
short
faced
breed
has
nearly
or
quite
lost
this
habit
;
nevertheless
,
without
any
thought
on
the
subject
,
these
tumblers
are
kept
in
the
same
group
,
because
allied
in
blood
and
alike
in
some
other
respects
.
With
species
in
a
state
of
nature
,
every
naturalist
has
in
fact
brought
descent
into
his
classification
;
for
he
includes
in
his
lowest
grade
,
that
of
species
,
the
two
sexes
;
and
how
enormously
these
sometimes
differ
in
the
most
important
characters
,
is
known
to
every
naturalist
:
scarcely
a
single
fact
can
be
predicated
in
common
of
the
adult
males
and
hermaphrodites
of
certain
cirripedes
,
and
yet
no
one
dreams
of
separating
them
.
As
soon
as
the
three
orchidean
forms
,
Monachanthus
,
Myanthus
,
and
Catasetum
,
which
had
previously
been
ranked
as
three
distinct
genera
,
were
known
to
be
sometimes
produced
on
the
same
plant
,
they
were
immediately
considered
as
varieties
;
and
now
I
have
been
able
to
show
that
they
are
the
male
,
female
,
and
hermaphrodite
forms
of
the
same
species
.
The
naturalist
includes
as
one
species
the
various
larval
stages
of
the
same
individual
,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
and
from
the
adult
,
as
well
as
the
so
called
alternate
generations
of
Steenstrup
,
which
can
only
in
a
technical
sense
be
considered
as
the
same
individual
.
He
includes
monsters
and
varieties
,
not
from
their
partial
resemblance
to
the
parent
form
,
but
because
they
are
descended
from
it
.
As
descent
has
universally
been
used
in
classing
together
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
though
the
males
and
females
and
larvae
are
sometimes
extremely
different
;
and
as
it
has
been
used
in
classing
varieties
which
have
undergone
a
certain
,
and
sometimes
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
,
may
not
this
same
element
of
descent
have
been
unconsciously
used
in
grouping
species
under
genera
,
and
genera
under
higher
groups
,
all
under
the
so
called
natural
system
?
I
believe
it
has
been
unconsciously
used
;
and
thus
only
can
I
understand
the
several
rules
and
guides
which
have
been
followed
by
our
best
systematists
.
As
we
have
no
written
pedigrees
,
we
are
forced
to
trace
community
of
descent
by
resemblances
of
any
kind
.
Therefore
we
chose
those
characters
which
are
the
least
likely
to
have
been
modified
,
in
relation
to
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
each
species
has
been
recently
exposed
.
Rudimentary
structures
on
this
view
are
as
good
as
,
or
even
better
than
,
other
parts
of
the
organisation
.
We
care
not
how
trifling
a
character
may
be
let
it
be
the
mere
inflection
of
the
angle
of
the
jaw
,
the
manner
in
which
an
insect's
wing
is
folded
,
whether
the
skin
be
covered
by
hair
or
feathers
if
it
prevail
throughout
many
and
different
species
,
especially
those
having
very
different
habits
of
life
,
it
assumes
high
value
;
for
we
can
account
for
its
presence
in
so
many
forms
with
such
different
habits
,
only
by
inheritance
from
a
common
parent
.
We
may
err
in
this
respect
in
regard
to
single
points
of
structure
,
but
when
several
characters
,
let
them
be
ever
so
trifling
,
concur
throughout
a
large
group
of
beings
having
different
habits
,
we
may
feel
almost
sure
,
on
the
theory
of
descent
,
that
these
characters
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
ancestor
;
and
we
know
that
such
aggregated
characters
have
especial
value
in
classification
.
We
can
understand
why
a
species
or
a
group
of
species
may
depart
from
its
allies
,
in
several
of
its
most
important
characteristics
,
and
yet
be
safely
classed
with
them
.
This
may
be
safely
done
,
and
is
often
done
,
as
long
as
a
sufficient
number
of
characters
,
let
them
be
ever
so
unimportant
,
betrays
the
hidden
bond
of
community
of
descent
.
Let
two
forms
have
not
a
single
character
in
common
,
yet
,
if
these
extreme
forms
are
connected
together
by
a
chain
of
intermediate
groups
,
we
may
at
once
infer
their
community
of
descent
,
and
we
put
them
all
into
the
same
class
.
As
we
find
organs
of
high
physiological
importance
those
which
serve
to
preserve
life
under
the
most
diverse
conditions
of
existence
are
generally
the
most
constant
,
we
attach
especial
value
to
them
;
but
if
these
same
organs
,
in
another
group
or
section
of
a
group
,
are
found
to
differ
much
,
we
at
once
value
them
less
in
our
classification
.
We
shall
presently
see
why
embryological
characters
are
of
such
high
classificatory
importance
.
Geographical
distribution
may
sometimes
be
brought
usefully
into
play
in
classing
large
genera
,
because
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
,
inhabiting
any
distinct
and
isolated
region
,
are
in
all
probability
descended
from
the
same
parents
.
Analogical
Resemblances
.
We
can
understand
,
on
the
above
views
,
the
very
important
distinction
between
real
affinities
and
analogical
or
adaptive
resemblances
.
Lamarck
first
called
attention
to
this
subject
,
and
he
has
been
ably
followed
by
Macleay
and
others
.
The
resemblance
in
the
shape
of
the
body
and
in
the
fin
like
anterior
limbs
between
dugongs
and
whales
,
and
between
these
two
orders
of
mammals
and
fishes
,
are
analogical
.
So
is
the
resemblance
between
a
mouse
and
a
shrewmouse
(
Sorex
)
,
which
belong
to
different
orders
;
and
the
still
closer
resemblance
,
insisted
on
by
Mr
.
Mivart
,
between
the
mouse
and
a
small
marsupial
animal
(
Antechinus
)
of
Australia
.
These
latter
resemblances
may
be
accounted
for
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
by
adaptation
for
similarly
active
movements
through
thickets
and
herbage
,
together
with
concealment
from
enemies
.
Amongst
insects
there
are
innumerable
similar
instances
;
thus
Linnaeus
,
misled
by
external
appearances
,
actually
classed
an
homopterous
insect
as
a
moth
.
We
see
something
of
the
same
kind
even
with
our
domestic
varieties
,
as
in
the
strikingly
similar
shape
of
the
body
in
the
improved
breeds
of
the
Chinese
and
common
pig
,
which
are
descended
from
distinct
species
;
and
in
the
similarly
thickened
stems
of
the
common
and
specifically
distinct
Swedish
turnip
.
The
resemblance
between
the
greyhound
and
the
race
horse
is
hardly
more
fanciful
than
the
analogies
which
have
been
drawn
by
some
authors
between
widely
different
animals
.
On
the
view
of
characters
being
of
real
importance
for
classification
,
only
in
so
far
as
they
reveal
descent
,
we
can
clearly
understand
why
analogical
or
adaptive
characters
,
although
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
being
,
are
almost
valueless
to
the
systematist
.
For
animals
,
belonging
to
two
most
distinct
lines
of
descent
,
may
have
become
adapted
to
similar
conditions
,
and
thus
have
assumed
a
close
external
resemblance
;
but
such
resemblances
will
not
reveal
will
rather
tend
to
conceal
their
blood
relationship
.
We
can
thus
understand
the
apparent
paradox
,
that
the
very
same
characters
are
analogical
when
one
group
is
compared
with
another
,
but
give
true
affinities
when
the
members
of
the
same
group
are
compared
together
:
thus
,
the
shape
of
the
body
and
fin
like
limbs
are
only
analogical
when
whales
are
compared
with
fishes
,
being
adaptations
in
both
classes
for
swimming
through
the
water
;
but
between
the
several
members
of
the
whale
family
,
the
shape
of
the
body
and
the
fin
like
limbs
offer
characters
exhibiting
true
affinity
;
for
as
these
parts
are
so
nearly
similar
throughout
the
whole
family
,
we
cannot
doubt
that
they
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
ancestor
.
So
it
is
with
fishes
.
Numerous
cases
could
be
given
of
striking
resemblances
in
quite
distinct
beings
between
single
parts
or
organs
,
which
have
been
adapted
for
the
same
functions
.
A
good
instance
is
afforded
by
the
close
resemblance
of
the
jaws
of
the
dog
and
Tasmanian
wolf
or
Thylacinus
,
animals
which
are
widely
sundered
in
the
natural
system
.
But
this
resemblance
is
confined
to
general
appearance
,
as
in
the
prominence
of
the
canines
,
and
in
the
cutting
shape
of
the
molar
teeth
.
For
the
teeth
really
differ
much
:
thus
the
dog
has
on
each
side
of
the
upper
jaw
four
pre
molars
and
only
two
molars
;
whilst
the
Thylacinus
has
three
pre
molars
and
four
molars
.
The
molars
also
differ
much
in
the
two
animals
in
relative
size
and
structure
.
The
adult
dentition
is
preceded
by
a
widely
different
milk
dentition
.
Any
one
may
of
course
deny
that
the
teeth
in
either
case
have
been
adapted
for
tearing
flesh
,
through
the
natural
selection
of
successive
variations
;
but
if
this
be
admitted
in
the
one
case
,
it
is
unintelligible
to
me
that
it
should
be
denied
in
the
other
.
I
am
glad
to
find
that
so
high
an
authority
as
Professor
Flower
has
come
to
this
same
conclusion
.
The
extraordinary
cases
given
in
a
former
chapter
,
of
widely
different
fishes
possessing
electric
organs
,
of
widely
different
insects
possessing
luminous
organs
,
and
of
orchids
and
asclepiads
having
pollen
masses
with
viscid
discs
,
come
under
this
same
head
of
analogical
resemblances
.
But
these
cases
are
so
wonderful
that
they
were
introduced
as
difficulties
or
objections
to
our
theory
.
In
all
such
cases
some
fundamental
difference
in
the
growth
or
development
of
the
parts
,
and
generally
in
their
matured
structure
,
can
be
detected
.
The
end
gained
is
the
same
,
but
the
means
,
though
appearing
superficially
to
be
the
same
,
are
essentially
different
.
The
principle
formerly
alluded
to
under
the
term
of
analogical
variation
has
probably
in
these
cases
often
come
into
play
;
that
is
,
the
members
of
the
same
class
,
although
only
distantly
allied
,
have
inherited
so
much
in
common
in
their
constitution
,
that
they
are
apt
to
vary
under
similar
exciting
causes
in
a
similar
manner
;
and
this
would
obviously
aid
in
the
acquirement
through
natural
selection
of
parts
or
organs
,
strikingly
like
each
other
,
independently
of
their
direct
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
.
As
species
belonging
to
distinct
classes
have
often
been
adapted
by
successive
slight
modifications
to
live
under
nearly
similar
circumstances
,
to
inhabit
,
for
instance
,
the
three
elements
of
land
,
air
,
and
water
,
we
can
perhaps
understand
how
it
is
that
a
numerical
parallelism
has
sometimes
been
observed
between
the
sub
groups
of
distinct
classes
.
A
naturalist
,
struck
with
a
parallelism
of
this
nature
,
by
arbitrarily
raising
or
sinking
the
value
of
the
groups
in
several
classes
(
and
all
our
experience
shows
that
their
valuation
is
as
yet
arbitrary
)
,
could
easily
extend
the
parallelism
over
a
wide
range
;
and
thus
the
septenary
,
quinary
,
quarternary
and
ternary
classifications
have
probably
arisen
.
There
is
another
and
curious
class
of
cases
in
which
close
external
resemblance
does
not
depend
on
adaptation
to
similar
habits
of
life
,
but
has
been
gained
for
the
sake
of
protection
.
I
allude
to
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
certain
butterflies
imitate
,
as
first
described
by
Mr
.
Bates
,
other
and
quite
distinct
species
.
This
excellent
observer
has
shown
that
in
some
districts
of
S
.
America
,
where
,
for
instance
,
an
Ithomia
abounds
in
gaudy
swarms
,
another
butterfly
,
namely
,
a
leptalis
,
is
often
found
mingled
in
the
same
flock
;
and
the
latter
so
closely
resembles
the
Ithomia
in
every
shade
and
stripe
of
colour
and
even
in
the
shape
of
its
wings
,
that
Mr
.
Bates
,
with
his
eyes
sharpened
by
collecting
during
eleven
years
,
was
,
though
always
on
his
guard
,
continually
deceived
.
When
the
mockers
and
the
mocked
are
caught
and
compared
,
they
are
found
to
be
very
different
in
essential
structure
,
and
to
belong
not
only
to
distinct
genera
,
but
often
to
distinct
families
.
Had
this
mimicry
occurred
in
only
one
or
two
instances
,
it
might
have
been
passed
over
as
a
strange
coincidence
.
But
,
if
we
proceed
from
a
district
where
one
Leptalis
imitates
an
Ithomia
,
another
mocking
and
mocked
species
,
belonging
to
the
same
two
genera
,
equally
close
in
their
resemblance
,
may
be
found
.
Altogether
no
less
than
ten
genera
are
enumerated
,
which
include
species
that
imitate
other
butterflies
.
The
mockers
and
mocked
always
inhabit
the
same
region
;
we
never
find
an
imitator
living
remote
from
the
form
which
it
imitates
.
The
mockers
are
almost
invariably
rare
insects
;
the
mocked
in
almost
every
case
abound
in
swarms
.
In
the
same
district
in
which
a
species
of
laptalis
closely
imitates
an
Ithomia
,
there
are
sometimes
other
Lepidoptera
mimicking
the
same
Ithomia
:
so
that
in
the
same
place
,
species
of
three
genera
of
butterflies
and
even
a
moth
are
found
all
closely
resembling
a
butterfly
belonging
to
a
fourth
genus
.
It
deserves
especial
notice
that
many
of
the
mimicking
forms
of
the
leptalis
,
as
well
as
of
the
mimicked
forms
,
can
be
shown
by
a
graduated
series
to
be
merely
varieties
of
the
same
species
;
whilst
others
are
undoubtedly
distinct
species
.
But
why
,
it
may
be
asked
,
are
certain
forms
treated
as
the
mimicked
and
others
as
the
mimickers
?
Mr
.
Bates
satisfactorily
answers
this
question
,
by
showing
that
the
form
which
is
imitated
keeps
the
usual
dress
of
the
group
to
which
it
belongs
,
whilst
the
counterfeiters
have
changed
their
dress
and
do
not
resemble
their
nearest
allies
.
We
are
next
led
to
inquire
what
reason
can
be
assigned
for
certain
butterflies
and
moths
so
often
assuming
the
dress
of
another
and
quite
distinct
form
;
why
,
to
the
perplexity
of
naturalists
,
has
nature
condescended
to
the
tricks
of
the
stage
?
Mr
.
Bates
has
,
no
doubt
,
hit
on
the
true
explanation
.
The
mocked
forms
,
which
always
abound
in
numbers
,
must
habitually
escape
destruction
to
a
large
extent
,
otherwise
they
could
not
exist
in
such
swarms
;
and
a
large
amount
of
evidence
has
now
been
collected
,
showing
that
they
are
distasteful
to
birds
and
other
insect
devouring
animals
.
The
mocking
forms
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
inhabit
the
same
district
,
are
comparatively
rare
,
and
belong
to
rare
groups
;
hence
they
must
suffer
habitually
from
some
danger
,
for
otherwise
,
from
the
number
of
eggs
laid
by
all
butterflies
,
they
would
in
three
or
four
generations
swarm
over
the
whole
country
.
Now
if
a
member
of
one
of
these
persecuted
and
rare
groups
were
to
assume
a
dress
so
like
that
of
a
well
protected
species
that
it
continually
deceived
the
practised
eye
of
an
entomologist
,
it
would
often
deceive
predaceous
birds
and
insects
,
and
thus
often
escape
destruction
.
Mr
.
Bates
may
almost
be
said
to
have
actually
witnessed
the
process
by
which
the
mimickers
have
come
so
closely
to
resemble
the
mimicked
;
for
he
found
that
some
of
the
forms
of
Leptalis
which
mimic
so
many
other
butterflies
,
varied
in
an
extreme
degree
.
In
one
district
several
varieties
occurred
,
and
of
these
one
alone
resembled
to
a
certain
extent
,
the
common
Ithomia
of
the
same
district
.
In
another
district
there
were
two
or
three
varieties
,
one
of
which
was
much
commoner
than
the
others
,
and
this
closely
mocked
another
form
of
Ithomia
.
From
facts
of
this
nature
,
Mr
.
Bates
concludes
that
the
leptalis
first
varies
;
and
when
a
variety
happens
to
resemble
in
some
degree
any
common
butterfly
inhabiting
the
same
district
,
this
variety
,
from
its
resemblance
to
a
flourishing
and
little
persecuted
kind
,
has
a
better
chance
of
escaping
destruction
from
predaceous
birds
and
insects
,
and
is
consequently
oftener
preserved
;
"
the
less
perfect
degrees
of
resemblance
being
generation
after
generation
eliminated
,
and
only
the
others
left
to
propagate
their
kind
.
"
So
that
here
we
have
an
excellent
illustration
of
natural
selection
.
Messrs
.
Wallace
and
Trimen
have
likewise
described
several
equally
striking
cases
of
imitation
in
the
Lepidoptera
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
and
Africa
,
and
with
some
other
insects
.
Mr
.
Wallace
has
also
detected
one
such
case
with
birds
,
but
we
have
none
with
the
larger
quadrupeds
.
The
much
greater
frequency
of
imitation
with
insects
than
with
other
animals
,
is
probably
the
consequence
of
their
small
size
;
insects
cannot
defend
themselves
,
excepting
indeed
the
kinds
furnished
with
a
sting
,
and
I
have
never
heard
of
an
instance
of
such
kinds
mocking
other
insects
,
though
they
are
mocked
;
insects
cannot
easily
escape
by
flight
from
the
larger
animals
which
prey
on
them
;
therefore
,
speaking
metaphorically
,
they
are
reduced
,
like
most
weak
creatures
,
to
trickery
and
dissimulation
.
It
should
be
observed
that
the
process
of
imitation
probably
never
commenced
between
forms
widely
dissimilar
in
colour
.
But
starting
with
species
already
somewhat
like
each
other
,
the
closest
resemblance
,
if
beneficial
,
could
readily
be
gained
by
the
above
means
;
and
if
the
imitated
form
was
subsequently
and
gradually
modified
through
any
agency
,
the
imitating
form
would
be
led
along
the
same
track
,
and
thus
be
altered
to
almost
any
extent
,
so
that
it
might
ultimately
assume
an
appearance
or
colouring
wholly
unlike
that
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
to
which
it
belonged
.
There
is
,
however
,
some
difficulty
on
this
head
,
for
it
is
necessary
to
suppose
in
some
cases
that
ancient
members
belonging
to
several
distinct
groups
,
before
they
had
diverged
to
their
present
extent
,
accidentally
resembled
a
member
of
another
and
protected
group
in
a
sufficient
degree
to
afford
some
slight
protection
;
this
having
given
the
basis
for
the
subsequent
acquisition
of
the
most
perfect
resemblance
.
On
the
Nature
of
the
Affinities
connecting
Organic
Beings
.
As
the
modified
descendants
of
dominant
species
,
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
,
tend
to
inherit
the
advantages
which
made
the
groups
to
which
they
belong
large
and
their
parents
dominant
,
they
are
almost
sure
to
spread
widely
,
and
to
seize
on
more
and
more
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
.
The
larger
and
more
dominant
groups
within
each
class
thus
tend
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
;
and
they
consequently
supplant
many
smaller
and
feebler
groups
.
Thus
we
can
account
for
the
fact
that
all
organisms
,
recent
and
extinct
,
are
included
under
a
few
great
orders
,
and
under
still
fewer
classes
.
As
showing
how
few
the
higher
groups
are
in
number
,
and
how
widely
they
are
spread
throughout
the
world
,
the
fact
is
striking
that
the
discovery
of
Australia
has
not
added
an
insect
belonging
to
a
new
class
;
and
that
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
,
as
I
learn
from
Dr
.
Hooker
,
it
has
added
only
two
or
three
families
of
small
size
.
In
the
chapter
on
Geological
Succession
I
attempted
to
show
,
on
the
principle
of
each
group
having
generally
diverged
much
in
character
during
the
long
continued
process
of
modification
,
how
it
is
that
the
more
ancient
forms
of
life
often
present
characters
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
existing
groups
.
As
some
few
of
the
old
and
intermediate
forms
have
transmitted
to
the
present
day
descendants
but
little
modified
,
these
constitute
our
so
called
osculant
or
aberrant
species
.
The
more
aberrant
any
form
is
,
the
greater
must
be
the
number
of
connecting
forms
which
have
been
exterminated
and
utterly
lost
.
And
we
have
some
evidence
of
aberrant
groups
having
suffered
severely
from
extinction
,
for
they
are
almost
always
represented
by
extremely
few
species
;
and
such
species
as
do
occur
are
generally
very
distinct
from
each
other
,
which
again
implies
extinction
.
The
genera
Ornithorhynchus
and
lepidosiren
,
for
example
,
would
not
have
been
less
aberrant
had
each
been
represented
by
a
dozen
species
,
instead
of
as
at
present
by
a
single
one
,
or
by
two
or
three
.
We
can
,
I
think
,
account
for
this
fact
only
by
looking
at
aberrant
groups
as
forms
which
have
been
conquered
by
more
successful
competitors
,
with
a
few
members
still
preserved
under
unusually
favourable
conditions
.
Mr
.
Waterhouse
has
remarked
that
,
when
a
member
belonging
to
one
group
of
animals
exhibits
an
affinity
to
a
quite
distinct
group
,
this
affinity
in
most
cases
is
general
and
not
special
;
thus
,
according
to
Mr
.
Waterhouse
,
of
all
rodents
,
the
bizcacha
is
most
nearly
related
to
marsupials
;
but
in
the
points
in
which
it
approaches
this
order
,
its
relations
are
general
,
that
is
,
not
to
any
one
marsupial
species
more
than
to
another
.
As
these
points
of
affinity
are
believed
to
be
real
and
not
merely
adaptive
,
they
must
be
due
in
accordance
with
our
view
to
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
.
Therefore
we
must
suppose
either
that
all
rodents
,
including
the
bizcacha
,
branched
off
from
some
ancient
marsupial
,
which
will
naturally
have
been
more
or
less
intermediate
in
character
with
respect
to
all
existing
marsupials
;
or
that
both
rodents
and
marsupials
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
,
and
that
both
groups
have
since
undergone
much
modification
in
divergent
directions
.
On
either
view
we
must
suppose
that
the
bizcacha
has
retained
,
by
inheritance
,
more
of
the
,
characters
of
its
ancient
progenitor
than
have
other
rodents
;
and
therefore
it
will
not
be
specially
related
to
any
one
existing
marsupial
,
but
indirectly
to
all
or
nearly
all
marsupials
,
from
having
partially
retained
the
character
of
their
common
progenitor
,
or
of
some
early
member
of
the
group
.
On
the
other
hand
,
of
all
marsupials
,
as
Mr
.
Waterhouse
has
remarked
,
the
Phascolomys
resembles
most
nearly
,
not
any
one
species
,
but
the
general
order
of
rodents
.
In
this
case
,
however
,
it
may
be
strongly
suspected
as
the
resemblance
is
only
analogical
,
owing
to
the
Phascolomys
having
become
adapted
to
habits
like
those
of
a
rodent
.
The
elder
De
Candolle
has
made
nearly
similar
observations
on
the
general
nature
of
the
affinities
of
distinct
families
of
plants
.
On
the
principle
of
the
multiplication
and
gradual
divergence
in
character
of
the
species
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
,
together
with
their
retention
by
inheritance
of
some
characters
in
common
,
we
can
understand
the
excessively
complex
and
radiating
affinities
by
which
all
the
members
of
the
same
family
or
higher
group
are
connected
together
.
For
the
common
progenitor
of
a
whole
family
,
now
broken
up
by
extinction
into
distinct
groups
and
sub
groups
,
will
have
transmitted
some
of
its
characters
,
modified
in
various
ways
and
degrees
,
to
all
the
species
;
and
they
will
consequently
be
related
to
each
other
by
circuitous
lines
of
affinity
of
various
lengths
(
as
may
be
seen
in
the
diagram
so
often
referred
to
)
,
mounting
up
through
many
predecessors
.
As
it
is
difficult
to
show
the
blood
relationship
between
the
numerous
kindred
of
any
ancient
and
noble
family
even
by
the
aid
of
a
genealogical
tree
,
and
almost
impossible
to
do
so
without
this
aid
,
we
can
understand
the
extraordinary
difficulty
which
naturalists
have
experienced
in
describing
,
without
the
aid
of
a
diagram
,
the
various
affinities
which
they
perceive
between
the
many
living
and
extinct
members
of
the
same
great
natural
class
.
Extinction
,
as
we
have
seen
in
the
fourth
chapter
,
has
played
an
important
part
in
defining
and
widening
the
intervals
between
the
several
groups
in
each
class
.
We
may
thus
account
for
the
distinctness
of
whole
classes
from
each
other
for
instance
,
of
birds
from
all
other
vertebrate
animals
by
the
belief
that
many
ancient
forms
of
life
have
been
utterly
lost
,
through
which
the
early
progenitors
of
birds
were
formerly
connected
with
the
early
progenitors
of
the
other
and
at
that
time
less
differentiated
vertebrate
classes
.
There
has
been
much
less
extinction
of
the
forms
of
life
which
once
connected
fishes
with
batrachians
.
There
has
been
still
less
within
some
whole
classes
,
for
instance
the
Crustacea
,
for
here
the
most
wonderfully
diverse
forms
are
still
linked
together
by
a
long
and
only
partially
broken
chain
of
affinities
.
Extinction
has
only
defined
the
groups
:
it
has
by
no
means
made
them
;
for
if
every
form
which
has
ever
lived
on
this
earth
were
suddenly
to
reappear
,
though
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
definitions
by
which
each
group
could
be
distinguished
,
still
a
natural
classification
,
or
at
least
a
natural
arrangement
,
would
be
possible
.
We
shall
see
this
by
turning
to
the
diagram
;
the
letters
,
A
to
L
,
may
represent
eleven
Silurian
genera
,
some
of
which
have
produced
large
groups
of
modified
descendants
,
with
every
link
in
each
branch
and
sub
branch
still
alive
;
and
the
links
not
greater
than
those
between
existing
varieties
.
In
this
case
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
definitions
by
which
the
several
members
of
the
several
groups
could
be
distinguished
from
their
more
immediate
parents
and
descendants
.
Yet
the
arrangement
in
the
diagram
would
still
hold
good
and
would
be
natural
;
for
,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
,
all
the
forms
descended
,
for
instance
,
from
A
,
would
have
something
in
common
.
In
a
tree
we
can
distinguish
this
or
that
branch
,
though
at
the
actual
fork
the
two
unite
and
blend
together
.
We
could
not
,
as
I
have
said
,
define
the
several
groups
;
but
we
could
pick
out
types
,
or
forms
,
representing
most
of
the
characters
of
each
group
,
whether
large
or
small
,
and
thus
give
a
general
idea
of
the
value
of
the
differences
between
them
.
This
is
what
we
should
be
driven
to
,
if
we
were
ever
to
succeed
in
collecting
all
the
forms
in
any
one
class
which
have
lived
throughout
all
time
and
space
.
Assuredly
we
shall
never
succeed
in
making
so
perfect
a
collection
:
nevertheless
,
in
certain
classes
,
we
are
tending
towards
:
this
end
;
and
Milne
Edwards
has
lately
insisted
,
in
an
able
paper
,
on
the
high
importance
of
looking
to
types
,
whether
or
not
we
can
separate
and
define
the
groups
to
which
such
types
belong
.
Finally
we
have
seen
that
natural
selection
,
which
follows
from
the
struggle
for
existence
,
and
which
almost
inevitably
leads
to
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
in
the
descendants
from
any
one
parent
species
,
explains
that
great
and
universal
feature
in
the
affinities
of
all
organic
beings
,
namely
,
their
subordination
in
group
under
group
.
We
use
the
element
of
descent
in
classing
the
individuals
of
both
sexes
and
of
all
ages
under
one
species
,
although
they
may
have
but
few
characters
in
common
;
we
use
descent
in
classing
acknowledged
varieties
,
however
different
they
may
be
from
their
parents
;
and
I
believe
that
this
element
of
descent
is
the
hidden
bond
of
connection
which
naturalists
have
sought
under
the
term
of
the
,
Natural
System
.
On
this
idea
of
the
natural
system
,
being
,
in
so
far
as
it
has
been
perfected
,
genealogical
in
its
arrangement
,
with
the
grades
of
difference
expressed
by
the
terms
genera
,
families
,
orders
,
&c
.
,
we
can
understand
the
rules
which
we
are
compelled
to
follow
in
our
classification
.
We
can
understand
why
we
value
certain
resemblances
far
more
than
others
;
why
we
use
rudimentary
and
useless
organs
,
or
others
of
trifling
physiological
importance
;
why
,
in
finding
the
relations
between
one
group
and
another
,
we
summarily
reject
analogical
or
adaptive
characters
,
and
yet
use
these
same
characters
within
the
limits
of
the
same
group
.
We
can
clearly
see
how
it
is
that
all
living
and
extinct
forms
can
be
grouped
together
within
a
few
great
classes
;
and
how
the
several
members
of
each
class
are
connected
together
by
the
most
complex
and
radiating
lines
of
affinities
.
We
shall
never
,
probably
,
disentangle
the
inextricable
web
of
the
affinities
between
the
members
of
any
one
class
;
but
when
we
have
a
distinct
object
in
view
,
and
do
not
look
to
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
,
we
may
hope
to
make
sure
but
slow
progress
.
Professor
Haeckel
in
his
Generelle
Morphologie
and
in
other
works
,
has
recently
brought
his
great
knowledge
and
abilities
to
bear
on
what
he
calls
phylogeny
,
or
the
lines
of
descent
of
all
organic
beings
.
In
drawing
up
the
several
series
he
trusts
chiefly
to
embryological
characters
,
but
receives
aid
from
homologous
and
rudimentary
organs
,
as
well
as
from
the
successive
periods
at
which
the
various
forms
of
life
are
believed
to
have
first
appeared
in
our
geological
formations
.
He
has
thus
boldly
made
a
great
beginning
,
and
shows
us
how
classification
will
in
the
future
be
treated
.
Morphology
We
have
seen
that
the
members
of
the
same
class
,
independently
of
their
habits
of
life
,
resemble
each
other
in
the
general
plan
of
their
organisation
.
This
resemblance
is
often
expressed
by
the
term
"
unity
of
type
"
;
or
by
saying
that
the
several
parts
and
organs
in
the
different
species
of
the
class
are
homologous
.
The
whole
subject
is
included
under
the
general
term
of
Morphology
.
This
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
departments
of
natural
history
,
and
may
almost
be
said
to
be
its
very
soul
.
What
can
be
more
curious
than
that
the
hand
of
a
man
,
formed
for
grasping
,
that
of
a
mole
for
digging
,
the
leg
of
the
horse
,
the
paddle
of
the
porpoise
,
and
the
wing
of
the
bat
,
should
all
be
constructed
on
the
same
pattern
,
and
should
include
similar
bones
,
in
the
same
relative
positions
?
How
curious
it
is
,
to
give
a
subordinate
though
striking
instance
,
that
the
hind
feet
of
the
kangaroo
,
which
are
so
well
fitted
for
bounding
over
the
open
plains
,
those
of
the
climbing
,
leaf
eating
koala
,
equally
well
fitted
for
grasping
the
branches
of
trees
,
those
of
the
ground
dwelling
,
insect
or
root
eating
,
bandicoots
,
and
those
of
some
other
Australian
marsupials
,
should
all
be
constructed
on
the
same
extraordinary
type
,
namely
with
the
bones
of
the
second
and
third
digits
extremely
slender
and
enveloped
within
the
same
skin
,
so
that
they
appear
like
a
single
toe
furnished
with
two
claws
.
Notwithstanding
this
similarity
of
pattern
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
hind
feet
of
these
several
animals
are
used
for
as
widely
different
purposes
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
.
The
case
is
rendered
all
the
more
striking
by
the
American
opossums
,
which
follow
nearly
the
same
habits
of
life
as
some
of
their
Australian
relatives
,
having
feet
constructed
on
the
ordinary
plan
.
Professor
Flower
,
from
whom
these
statements
are
taken
,
remarks
in
conclusion
:
"
We
may
call
this
conformity
to
type
,
without
getting
much
nearer
to
an
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
"
;
and
he
then
adds
"
but
is
it
not
powerfully
suggestive
of
true
relationship
,
of
inheritance
from
a
common
ancestor
?
"
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire
has
strongly
insisted
on
the
high
importance
of
relative
position
or
connection
in
homologous
parts
;
they
may
differ
to
almost
any
extent
in
form
and
size
,
and
yet
remain
connected
together
in
the
same
invariable
order
.
We
never
find
,
for
instance
,
the
bones
of
the
arm
and
fore
arm
,
or
of
the
thigh
and
leg
,
transposed
.
Hence
the
same
names
can
be
given
to
the
homologous
bones
in
widely
different
animals
.
We
see
the
same
great
law
in
the
construction
of
the
mouths
of
insects
:
what
can
be
more
different
than
the
immensely
long
spiral
proboscis
of
a
sphinxmoth
,
the
curious
folded
one
of
a
bee
or
bug
,
and
the
great
jaws
of
a
beetle
?
yet
all
these
organs
,
serving
for
such
widely
different
purposes
,
are
formed
by
infinitely
numerous
modifications
of
an
upper
lip
,
mandibles
,
and
two
pairs
of
maxillae
.
The
same
law
governs
the
construction
of
the
mouths
and
limbs
of
crustaceans
.
So
it
is
with
the
flowers
of
plants
.
Nothing
can
be
more
hopeless
than
to
attempt
to
explain
this
similarity
of
pattern
in
members
of
the
same
class
,
by
utility
or
by
the
doctrine
of
final
causes
.
The
hopelessness
of
the
attempt
has
been
expressly
admitted
by
Owen
in
his
most
interesting
work
on
the
Nature
of
Limbs
.
On
the
ordinary
view
of
the
independent
creation
of
each
being
,
we
can
only
say
that
so
it
is
;
that
it
has
pleased
the
Creator
to
construct
all
the
animals
and
plants
in
each
great
class
on
a
uniform
plan
;
but
this
is
not
a
scientific
explanation
.
The
explanation
is
to
a
large
extent
simple
on
the
theory
of
the
selection
of
successive
slight
modifications
,
each
modification
being
profitable
in
some
way
to
the
modified
form
,
but
often
affecting
by
correlation
other
parts
of
the
organisation
.
In
changes
of
this
nature
,
there
will
be
little
or
no
tendency
to
alter
the
original
pattern
,
or
to
transpose
the
parts
.
The
bones
of
a
limb
might
be
shortened
and
flattened
to
any
extent
,
becoming
at
the
same
time
enveloped
in
thick
membrane
,
so
as
to
serve
as
a
fin
;
or
a
webbed
hand
might
have
all
its
bones
,
or
certain
bones
,
lengthened
to
any
extent
,
with
the
membrane
connecting
them
increased
,
so
as
to
serve
as
a
wing
;
yet
all
these
would
not
tend
to
alter
the
framework
of
the
bones
or
the
relative
connection
of
the
parts
.
If
we
suppose
that
an
early
progenitor
the
archetype
as
it
may
be
called
of
all
mammals
,
birds
,
and
reptiles
,
had
its
limbs
constructed
on
the
existing
general
pattern
,
for
whatever
purpose
they
served
,
we
can
at
once
perceive
the
plain
signification
of
the
homologous
construction
of
the
limbs
throughout
the
class
.
So
with
the
mouths
of
insects
,
we
have
only
to
suppose
that
their
common
progenitor
had
an
upper
lip
,
mandibles
,
and
two
pairs
of
maxillae
,
these
parts
being
perhaps
very
simple
in
form
;
and
then
natural
selection
will
account
for
the
infinite
diversity
in
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
mouths
of
insects
.
Nevertheless
,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
general
pattern
of
an
organ
might
become
so
much
obscured
as
to
be
finally
lost
,
by
the
reduction
and
ultimately
by
the
complete
abortion
of
certain
parts
,
by
the
fusion
of
other
parts
,
and
by
the
doubling
or
multiplication
of
others
,
variations
which
we
know
to
be
within
the
limits
of
possibility
.
In
the
paddles
of
the
gigantic
extinct
sea
lizards
,
and
in
the
mouths
of
certain
suctorial
crustaceans
,
the
general
pattern
seems
thus
to
have
become
partially
obscured
.
There
is
another
and
equally
curious
branch
of
our
subject
;
namely
,
serial
homologies
,
or
the
comparison
of
the
different
parts
or
organs
in
the
same
individual
,
and
not
of
the
same
parts
or
organs
in
different
members
of
the
same
class
.
Most
physiologists
believe
that
the
bones
of
the
skull
are
homologous
that
is
,
correspond
in
number
and
in
relative
connexion
with
the
elemental
parts
of
a
certain
number
of
vertebrae
.
The
anterior
and
posterior
limbs
in
all
the
higher
vertebrate
classes
are
plainly
homologous
.
So
it
is
with
the
wonderfully
complex
jaws
and
legs
of
crustaceans
.
It
is
familiar
to
almost
every
one
,
that
in
a
flower
the
relative
position
of
the
sepals
,
petals
,
stamens
,
and
pistils
,
as
well
as
their
intimate
structure
,
are
intelligible
on
the
view
that
they
consist
of
metamorphosed
leaves
,
arranged
in
a
spire
.
In
monstrous
plants
,
we
often
get
direct
evidence
of
the
possibility
of
one
organ
being
transformed
into
another
;
and
we
can
actually
see
,
during
the
early
or
embryonic
stages
of
development
in
flowers
,
as
well
as
in
crustaceans
and
many
other
animals
,
that
organs
,
which
when
mature
become
extremely
different
are
at
first
exactly
alike
.
How
inexplicable
are
the
cases
of
serial
homologies
on
the
ordinary
view
of
creation!
Why
should
the
brain
be
enclosed
in
a
box
composed
of
such
numerous
and
such
extraordinarily
shaped
pieces
of
bone
,
apparently
representing
vertebrae
?
As
Owen
has
remarked
,
the
benefit
derived
from
the
yielding
of
the
separate
pieces
in
the
act
of
parturition
by
mammals
,
will
by
no
means
explain
the
same
construction
in
the
skulls
of
birds
and
reptiles
.
Why
should
similar
bones
have
been
created
to
form
the
wing
and
the
leg
of
a
bat
,
used
as
they
are
for
such
totally
different
purposes
,
namely
flying
and
walking
?
Why
should
one
crustacean
,
which
has
an
extremely
complex
mouth
formed
of
many
parts
,
consequently
always
have
fewer
legs
;
or
conversely
,
those
with
many
legs
have
simpler
mouths
?
Why
should
the
sepals
,
petals
,
stamens
,
and
pistils
,
in
each
flower
,
though
fitted
for
such
distinct
purposes
,
be
all
constructed
on
the
same
pattern
?
On
the
theory
of
natural
selection
,
we
can
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
answer
these
questions
.
We
need
not
here
consider
how
the
bodies
of
some
animals
first
became
divided
into
a
series
of
segments
,
or
how
they
became
divided
into
right
and
left
sides
,
with
corresponding
organs
,
for
such
questions
are
almost
beyond
investigation
.
It
is
,
however
,
probable
that
some
serial
structures
are
the
result
of
cells
multiplying
by
division
,
entailing
the
multiplication
of
the
parts
developed
from
such
cells
.
It
must
suffice
for
our
purpose
to
bear
in
mind
that
an
indefinite
repetition
of
the
same
part
or
organ
is
the
common
characteristic
,
as
Owen
has
remarked
,
of
all
low
or
little
specialised
forms
;
therefore
the
unknown
progenitor
of
the
Vertebrata
probably
possessed
many
vertebrae
;
the
unknown
progenitor
of
the
Articulata
,
many
segments
;
and
the
unknown
progenitor
of
flowering
plants
,
many
leaves
arranged
in
one
or
more
spires
.
We
have
also
formerly
seen
that
parts
many
times
repeated
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
,
not
only
in
number
,
but
in
form
.
Consequently
such
parts
,
being
already
present
in
considerable
numbers
,
and
being
highly
variable
,
would
naturally
afford
the
materials
for
adaptation
to
the
most
different
purposes
;
yet
they
would
generally
retain
,
through
the
force
of
inheritance
,
plain
traces
of
their
original
or
fundamental
resemblance
.
They
would
retain
this
resemblance
all
the
more
,
as
the
variations
,
which
afforded
the
basis
for
their
subsequent
modification
through
natural
selection
,
would
tend
from
the
first
to
be
similar
;
the
parts
being
at
an
early
stage
of
growth
alike
,
and
being
subjected
to
nearly
the
same
conditions
.
Such
parts
,
whether
more
or
less
modified
,
unless
their
common
origin
became
wholly
obscured
,
would
be
serially
homologous
.
In
the
great
class
of
molluscs
,
though
the
parts
in
distinct
species
can
be
shown
to
be
homologous
,
only
a
few
serial
homologies
,
such
as
the
valves
of
chitons
,
can
be
indicated
;
that
is
,
we
are
seldom
enabled
to
say
that
one
part
is
homologous
with
another
part
in
the
same
individual
.
And
we
can
understand
this
fact
;
for
in
molluscs
,
even
in
the
lowest
members
of
the
class
,
we
do
not
find
nearly
so
much
indefinite
repetition
of
any
one
part
as
we
find
in
the
other
great
classes
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
.
But
morphology
is
a
much
more
complex
subject
than
it
at
first
appears
,
as
has
lately
been
well
shown
in
a
remarkable
paper
by
Mr
.
E
.
Ray
Lankester
,
who
has
drawn
an
important
distinction
between
certain
classes
of
cases
which
have
all
been
equally
ranked
by
naturalists
as
homologous
.
He
proposes
to
call
the
structures
which
resemble
each
other
in
distinct
animals
,
owing
to
their
descent
from
a
common
progenitor
with
subsequent
modification
,
homogenous
;
and
the
resemblances
which
cannot
thus
be
accounted
for
,
he
proposes
to
call
homoplastic
.
For
instance
,
he
believes
that
the
hearts
of
birds
and
mammals
are
as
a
whole
homogenous
,
that
is
,
have
been
derived
from
a
common
progenitor
;
but
that
the
four
cavities
of
the
heart
in
the
two
classes
are
homoplastic
,
that
is
,
have
been
independently
developed
.
Mr
.
Lankester
also
adduces
the
close
resemblance
of
the
parts
on
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
body
,
and
in
the
successive
segments
of
the
same
individual
animal
;
and
here
we
have
parts
commonly
called
homologous
,
which
bear
no
relation
to
the
descent
of
distinct
species
from
a
common
progenitor
.
Homoplastic
structures
are
the
same
with
those
which
I
have
classed
,
though
in
a
very
imperfect
manner
,
as
analogous
modifications
or
resemblances
.
Their
formation
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
distinct
organisms
,
or
to
distinct
parts
of
the
same
organism
,
having
varied
in
an
analogous
manner
;
and
in
part
to
similar
modifications
,
having
been
preserved
for
the
same
general
purpose
or
function
,
of
which
many
instances
have
been
given
.
Naturalists
frequently
speak
of
the
skull
as
formed
of
metamorphosed
vertebrae
;
the
jaws
of
crabs
as
metamorphosed
legs
;
the
stamens
and
pistils
in
flowers
as
metamorphosed
leaves
;
but
it
would
in
most
cases
be
more
correct
,
as
Professor
Huxley
has
remarked
,
to
speak
of
both
skull
and
vertebrae
,
jaws
and
legs
,
&c
.
,
as
having
been
metamorphosed
,
not
one
from
the
other
,
as
they
now
exist
,
but
from
some
common
and
simpler
element
.
Most
naturalists
,
however
,
use
such
language
only
in
a
metaphorical
sense
;
they
are
far
from
meaning
that
during
a
long
course
of
descent
,
primordial
organs
of
any
kind
vertebrae
in
the
one
case
and
legs
in
the
other
have
actually
been
converted
into
skulls
or
jaws
.
Yet
so
strong
is
the
appearance
of
this
having
occurred
,
that
naturalists
can
hardly
avoid
employing
language
having
this
plain
signification
.
According
to
the
views
here
maintained
,
such
language
may
be
used
literally
;
and
the
wonderful
fact
of
the
jaws
,
for
instance
,
of
a
crab
retaining
numerous
characters
which
they
probably
would
have
retained
through
inheritance
,
if
they
had
really
been
metamorphosed
from
true
though
extremely
simple
legs
,
is
in
part
explained
.
Development
and
Embryology
This
is
one
of
the
most
important
subjects
in
the
whole
round
of
history
.
The
metamorphoses
of
insects
,
with
which
every
one
is
familiar
,
are
generally
effected
abruptly
by
a
few
stages
;
but
the
transformations
are
in
reality
numerous
and
gradual
,
though
concealed
.
A
certain
ephemerous
insect
(
Chloeon
)
during
its
development
,
moults
,
as
shown
by
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
,
above
twenty
times
,
and
each
time
undergoes
a
certain
amount
of
change
;
and
in
this
case
we
see
the
act
of
metamorphosis
performed
in
a
primary
and
gradual
manner
.
Many
insects
,
and
especially
certain
crustaceans
,
show
us
what
wonderful
changes
of
structure
can
be
effected
during
development
.
Such
changes
,
however
,
reach
their
acme
in
the
so
called
alternate
generations
of
some
of
the
lower
animals
.
It
is
,
for
instance
,
an
astonishing
fact
that
a
delicate
branching
coralline
,
studded
with
polypi
and
attached
to
a
submarine
rock
,
should
produce
,
first
by
budding
and
then
by
transverse
division
,
a
host
of
huge
floating
jelly
fishes
;
and
that
these
should
produce
eggs
,
from
which
are
hatched
swimming
animalcules
,
which
attach
themselves
to
rocks
and
become
developed
into
branching
corallines
;
and
so
on
in
an
endless
cycle
.
The
belief
in
the
essential
identity
of
the
process
of
alternate
generation
and
of
ordinary
metamorphosis
has
been
greatly
strengthened
by
Wagner's
discovery
of
the
larva
or
maggot
of
a
fly
,
namely
the
Cecidomyia
,
producing
asexually
other
larvae
,
and
these
others
,
which
finally
are
developed
into
mature
males
and
females
,
propagating
their
kind
in
the
ordinary
manner
by
eggs
.
It
may
be
worth
notice
that
when
Wagner's
remarkable
discovery
was
first
announced
,
I
was
asked
how
was
it
possible
to
account
for
the
larvae
of
this
fly
having
acquired
the
power
of
asexual
reproduction
.
As
long
as
the
case
remained
unique
no
answer
could
be
given
.
But
already
Grimm
has
shown
that
another
fly
,
a
Chironomus
,
reproduces
itself
in
nearly
the
same
manner
,
and
he
believes
that
this
occurs
frequently
in
the
Order
.
It
is
the
pupa
,
and
not
the
larva
,
of
the
Chironomus
which
has
this
power
;
and
Grimm
further
shows
that
this
case
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
"
unites
that
of
the
Cecidomyia
with
the
parthenogenesis
of
the
Coccidae
"
;
the
term
parthenogenesis
implying
that
the
mature
females
of
the
Coccidae
are
capable
of
producing
fertile
eggs
without
the
concourse
of
the
males
.
Certain
animals
belonging
to
several
classes
are
now
known
to
have
the
power
of
ordinary
reproduction
at
an
unusually
early
age
;
and
we
have
only
to
accelerate
parthenogenetic
production
by
gradual
steps
to
an
earlier
and
earlier
age
,
Chironomus
showing
us
an
almost
exactly
intermediate
stage
,
viz
.
,
that
of
the
pupa
and
we
can
perhaps
account
for
the
marvellous
case
of
the
Cecidomyia
.
It
has
already
been
stated
that
various
parts
in
the
same
individual
which
are
exactly
alike
during
an
early
embryonic
period
,
become
widely
different
and
serve
for
widely
different
purposes
in
the
adult
state
.
So
again
it
has
been
shown
that
generally
the
embryos
of
the
most
distinct
species
belonging
to
the
same
class
are
closely
similar
,
but
become
,
when
fully
developed
,
widely
dissimilar
.
A
better
proof
of
this
latter
fact
cannot
be
given
than
the
statement
by
von
Baer
that
"
The
embryos
of
mammalia
,
of
birds
,
lizards
,
and
snakes
,
probably
also
of
chelonia
are
in
their
earliest
states
exceedingly
like
one
another
,
both
as
a
whole
and
in
the
mode
of
development
of
their
parts
;
so
much
so
,
in
fact
,
that
we
can
often
distinguish
the
embryos
only
by
their
size
.
In
my
possession
are
two
little
embryos
in
spirit
,
whose
names
I
have
omitted
to
attach
,
and
at
present
I
am
quite
unable
to
say
to
what
class
they
belong
.
They
may
be
lizards
or
small
birds
,
or
very
young
mammalia
,
so
complete
is
the
similarity
in
the
mode
of
formation
of
the
head
and
trunk
in
these
animals
.
The
extremities
,
however
,
are
still
absent
in
these
embryos
.
But
even
if
they
had
existed
in
the
earliest
stage
of
their
development
we
should
learn
nothing
,
for
the
feet
of
lizards
and
mammals
,
the
wings
and
feet
of
birds
,
no
less
than
the
hands
and
feet
of
man
,
all
arise
from
the
same
fundamental
form
.
"
The
larvae
of
most
crustaceans
,
at
corresponding
stages
of
development
,
closely
resemble
each
other
,
however
different
the
adult
may
become
;
and
so
it
is
with
very
many
other
animals
.
A
trace
of
the
law
of
embryonic
resemblance
occasionally
lasts
till
a
rather
late
age
;
thus
birds
of
the
same
genus
,
and
of
allied
genera
,
often
resemble
each
other
in
their
immature
plumage
;
as
we
see
in
the
spotted
feathers
in
the
young
of
the
thrush
group
.
In
the
cat
tribe
,
most
of
the
species
when
adult
are
striped
or
spotted
in
lines
;
and
stripes
or
spots
can
be
plainly
distinguished
in
the
whelp
of
the
lion
and
the
puma
.
We
occasionally
though
rarely
see
something
of
the
same
kind
in
plants
;
thus
the
first
leaves
of
the
ulex
or
furze
,
and
the
first
leaves
of
the
phyllodineous
aeacias
,
are
pinnate
or
divided
like
the
ordinary
leaves
of
the
leguminosae
.
The
points
of
structure
,
in
which
the
embryos
of
widely
different
animals
within
the
same
class
resemble
each
other
,
often
have
no
direct
relation
to
their
conditions
of
existence
.
We
cannot
,
for
instance
,
suppose
that
in
the
embryos
of
the
vertebrata
the
peculiar
looplike
courses
of
the
arteries
near
the
branchial
slits
are
related
to
similar
conditions
,
in
the
young
mammal
which
is
nourished
in
the
womb
of
its
mother
,
in
the
egg
of
the
bird
which
is
hatched
in
a
nest
,
and
in
the
spawn
of
a
frog
under
water
.
We
have
no
more
reason
to
believe
in
such
a
relation
,
than
we
have
to
believe
that
the
similar
bones
in
the
hand
of
a
man
,
wing
of
a
bat
,
and
fin
of
a
porpoise
,
are
related
to
similar
conditions
of
life
.
No
one
supposes
that
the
stripes
on
the
whelp
of
a
lion
,
or
the
spots
on
the
young
blackbird
,
are
of
any
use
to
these
animals
.
The
case
,
however
,
is
different
when
an
animal
during
any
part
of
its
embryonic
career
is
active
,
and
has
to
provide
for
itself
.
The
period
of
activity
may
come
on
earlier
or
later
in
life
;
but
whenever
it
comes
on
,
the
adaptation
of
the
larva
to
its
conditions
of
life
is
just
as
perfect
and
as
beautiful
as
in
the
adult
animal
.
In
how
important
a
manner
this
has
acted
,
has
recently
been
well
shown
by
Sir
J
.
Lubbock
in
his
remarks
on
the
close
similarity
of
the
larvae
of
some
insects
belonging
to
very
different
orders
,
and
on
the
dissimilarity
of
the
larvae
of
other
insects
within
the
same
order
,
according
to
their
habits
of
life
.
Owing
to
such
adaptations
,
the
similarity
of
the
larvae
of
allied
animals
is
sometimes
greatly
obscured
;
especially
when
there
is
a
division
of
labour
during
the
different
stages
of
development
,
as
when
the
same
larva
has
during
one
stage
to
search
for
food
,
and
during
another
stage
has
to
search
for
a
place
of
attachment
.
Cases
can
even
be
given
of
the
larvae
of
allied
species
,
or
groups
of
species
,
differing
more
from
each
other
than
do
the
adults
.
In
most
cases
,
however
,
the
larvae
,
though
active
,
still
obey
,
more
or
less
closely
,
the
law
of
common
embryonic
resemblance
.
Cirripedes
afford
a
good
instance
of
this
;
even
the
illustrious
Cuvier
did
not
perceive
that
a
barnacle
was
a
crustacean
:
but
a
glance
at
the
larva
shows
this
in
an
unmistakable
manner
.
So
again
the
two
main
divisions
of
cirripedes
,
the
pedunculated
and
sessile
,
though
differing
widely
in
external
appearance
,
have
larvae
in
all
their
stages
barely
distinguishable
.
The
embryo
in
the
course
of
development
generally
rises
in
organisation
;
I
use
this
expression
,
though
I
am
aware
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
define
clearly
what
is
meant
by
the
organisation
being
higher
or
lower
.
But
no
one
probably
will
dispute
that
the
butterfly
is
higher
than
the
caterpillar
.
In
some
cases
,
however
,
the
mature
animal
must
be
considered
as
lower
in
the
scale
than
the
larva
,
as
with
certain
parasitic
crustaceans
.
To
refer
once
again
to
cirripedes
:
the
larvae
in
the
first
stage
have
three
pairs
of
locomotive
organs
,
a
simple
single
eye
,
and
a
probosciformed
mouth
,
with
which
they
feed
largely
,
for
they
increase
much
in
size
.
In
the
second
stage
,
answering
to
the
chrysalis
stage
of
butterflies
,
they
have
six
pairs
of
beautifully
constructed
natatory
legs
,
a
pair
of
magnificent
compound
eyes
,
and
extremely
complex
antennae
;
but
they
have
a
closed
and
imperfect
mouth
,
and
cannot
feed
:
their
function
at
this
stage
is
,
to
search
out
by
their
well
developed
organs
of
sense
,
and
to
reach
by
their
active
powers
of
swimming
,
a
proper
place
on
which
to
become
attached
and
to
undergo
their
final
metamorphosis
.
When
this
is
completed
they
are
fixed
for
life
:
their
legs
are
now
converted
into
prehensile
organs
;
they
again
obtain
a
well
constructed
mouth
;
but
they
have
no
antennae
,
and
their
two
eyes
are
now
reconverted
into
a
minute
,
single
,
simple
eye
spot
.
In
this
last
and
complete
state
,
cirripedes
may
be
considered
as
either
more
highly
or
more
lowly
organised
than
they
were
in
the
larval
condition
.
But
in
some
genera
the
larvae
become
developed
into
hermaphrodites
having
the
ordinary
structure
,
and
into
what
I
have
called
complemental
males
;
and
in
the
latter
the
development
has
assuredly
been
retrograde
,
for
the
male
is
a
mere
sack
,
which
lives
for
a
short
time
and
is
destitute
of
mouth
,
stomach
,
and
every
other
organ
of
importance
,
excepting
those
for
reproduction
.
We
are
so
much
accustomed
to
see
a
difference
in
structure
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
,
that
we
are
tempted
to
look
at
this
difference
as
in
some
necessary
manner
contingent
on
growth
.
But
there
is
no
reason
why
,
for
instance
,
the
wing
of
a
bat
,
or
the
fin
of
a
porpoise
,
should
not
have
been
sketched
out
with
all
their
parts
in
proper
proportion
,
as
soon
as
any
part
became
visible
.
In
some
whole
groups
of
animals
and
in
certain
members
of
other
groups
this
is
the
case
,
and
the
embryo
does
not
at
any
period
differ
widely
from
the
adult
:
thus
Owen
has
remarked
in
regard
to
cuttlefish
,
"
There
is
no
metamorphosis
;
the
cephalopodic
character
is
manifested
long
before
the
parts
of
the
embryo
are
completed
.
"
Landshells
and
fresh
water
crustaceans
are
born
having
their
proper
forms
,
whilst
the
marine
members
of
the
same
two
great
classes
pass
through
considerable
and
often
great
changes
during
their
development
.
Spiders
,
again
,
barely
undergo
any
metamorphosis
.
The
larvae
of
most
insects
pass
through
a
worm
like
stage
,
whether
they
are
active
and
adapted
to
diversified
habits
,
or
are
inactive
from
being
placed
in
the
midst
of
proper
nutriment
or
from
being
fed
by
their
parents
;
but
in
some
few
cases
,
as
in
that
of
Aphis
,
if
we
look
to
the
admirable
drawings
of
the
development
of
this
insect
,
by
Professor
Huxley
,
we
see
hardly
any
trace
of
the
vermiform
stage
.
Sometimes
it
is
only
the
earlier
developmental
stages
which
fail
.
Thus
Fritz
Muller
has
made
the
remarkable
discovery
that
certain
shrimp
like
crustaceans
(
allied
to
Penaeus
)
first
appear
under
the
simple
nauplius
form
,
and
after
passing
through
two
or
more
zoea
stages
,
and
then
through
the
mysis
stage
,
finally
acquire
their
mature
structure
:
now
in
the
whole
great
malacostracan
order
,
to
which
these
crustaceans
belong
,
no
other
member
is
as
yet
known
to
be
first
developed
under
the
nauplius
form
,
though
many
appear
as
zoeas
;
nevertheless
Muller
assigns
reasons
for
his
belief
,
that
if
there
had
been
no
suppression
of
development
,
all
these
crustaceans
would
have
appeared
as
nauplii
.
How
,
then
,
can
we
explain
these
several
facts
in
embryology
,
namely
,
the
very
general
,
though
not
universal
,
difference
in
structure
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
;
the
various
parts
in
the
same
individual
embryo
,
which
ultimately
become
very
unlike
and
serve
for
diverse
purposes
,
being
at
an
early
period
of
growth
alike
;
the
common
,
but
not
invariable
,
resemblance
between
the
embryos
or
larvae
of
the
most
distinct
species
in
the
same
class
;
the
embryo
often
retaining
,
whilst
within
the
egg
or
womb
,
structures
which
are
of
no
service
to
it
,
either
at
that
or
at
a
later
period
of
life
;
on
the
other
hand
,
larvae
,
which
have
to
provide
for
their
own
wants
,
being
perfectly
adapted
to
the
surrounding
conditions
;
and
lastly
the
fact
of
certain
larvae
standing
higher
in
the
scale
of
organisation
than
the
mature
animal
into
which
they
are
developed
?
I
believe
that
all
these
facts
can
be
explained
,
as
follows
.
It
is
commonly
assumed
,
perhaps
from
monstrosities
affecting
the
embryo
at
a
very
early
period
,
that
slight
variations
or
individual
differences
necessarily
appear
at
an
equally
early
period
.
We
have
little
evidence
on
this
head
,
but
what
we
have
certainly
points
the
other
way
;
for
it
is
notorious
that
breeders
of
cattle
,
horses
,
and
various
fancy
animals
,
cannot
positively
tell
,
until
some
time
after
birth
,
what
will
be
the
merits
or
demerits
of
their
young
animals
.
We
see
this
plainly
in
our
own
children
;
we
cannot
tell
whether
a
child
will
be
tall
or
short
,
or
what
its
precise
features
will
be
.
The
question
is
not
,
at
what
period
of
life
each
variation
may
have
been
caused
,
but
at
what
period
the
effects
are
displayed
.
The
cause
may
have
acted
,
and
I
believe
often
has
acted
,
on
one
or
both
parents
before
the
act
of
generation
.
It
deserves
notice
that
it
is
of
no
importance
to
a
very
young
animal
,
as
long
as
it
remains
in
its
mother's
womb
or
in
the
egg
,
or
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
and
protected
by
its
parent
,
whether
most
of
its
characters
are
acquired
little
earlier
or
later
in
life
.
It
would
not
signify
,
for
instance
,
to
a
bird
which
obtained
its
food
by
having
a
much
curved
beak
whether
or
not
whilst
young
it
possessed
a
beak
of
this
shape
,
as
long
as
it
was
fed
by
its
parents
.
I
have
stated
in
the
first
chapter
,
that
at
whatever
age
a
variation
first
appears
in
the
parent
,
it
tends
to
re
appear
at
a
corresponding
age
in
the
offspring
.
Certain
variations
can
only
appear
at
corresponding
ages
;
for
instance
,
peculiarities
in
the
caterpillar
,
cocoon
,
or
imago
states
of
the
silk
moth
;
or
,
again
,
in
the
full
grown
horns
of
cattle
.
But
variations
,
which
,
for
all
that
we
can
see
might
have
first
appeared
either
earlier
or
later
in
life
,
likewise
tend
to
reappear
at
a
corresponding
age
in
the
offspring
and
parent
.
I
am
far
from
meaning
that
this
is
invariably
the
case
,
and
I
could
give
several
exceptional
cases
of
variations
(
taking
the
word
in
the
largest
sense
)
which
have
supervened
at
an
earlier
age
in
the
child
than
in
the
parent
.
These
two
principles
,
namely
,
that
slight
variations
generally
appear
at
a
not
very
early
period
of
life
,
and
are
inherited
at
a
corresponding
not
early
period
,
explain
,
as
I
believe
,
all
the
above
specified
leading
facts
in
embryology
.
But
first
let
us
look
to
a
few
analogous
cases
in
our
domestic
varieties
.
Some
authors
who
have
written
on
dogs
,
maintain
that
the
greyhound
and
bulldog
,
though
so
different
,
are
really
closely
allied
varieties
,
descended
from
the
same
wild
stock
;
hence
I
was
curious
to
see
how
far
their
puppies
differed
from
each
other
:
I
was
told
by
breeders
that
they
differed
just
as
much
as
their
parents
,
and
this
,
judging
by
the
eye
,
seemed
almost
to
be
the
case
;
but
on
actually
measuring
the
old
dogs
and
their
six
days
old
puppies
,
I
found
that
the
puppies
had
not
acquired
nearly
their
full
amount
of
proportional
difference
.
So
,
again
,
I
was
told
that
the
foals
of
cart
and
race
horses
breeds
which
have
been
almost
wholly
formed
by
selection
under
domestication
differed
as
much
as
the
full
grown
animals
;
but
having
had
careful
measurements
made
of
the
dams
and
of
three
days
old
colts
of
race
and
heavy
cart
horses
,
I
find
that
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
.
As
we
have
conclusive
evidence
that
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
are
descended
from
a
single
wild
species
,
I
compared
the
young
within
twelve
hours
after
being
hatched
;
I
carefully
measured
the
proportions
(
but
will
not
here
give
the
details
)
of
the
beak
,
width
of
mouth
,
length
of
nostril
and
of
eyelid
,
size
of
feet
and
length
of
leg
,
in
the
wild
parent
species
,
in
pouters
,
fantails
,
runts
,
barbs
,
dragons
,
carriers
,
and
tumblers
.
Now
some
of
these
birds
,
when
mature
,
differ
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
in
the
length
and
form
of
beak
,
and
in
other
characters
,
that
they
would
certainly
have
been
ranked
as
distinct
genera
if
found
in
a
state
of
nature
.
But
when
the
nestling
birds
of
these
several
breeds
were
placed
in
a
row
,
though
most
of
them
could
just
be
distinguished
,
the
proportional
differences
in
the
above
specified
points
were
incomparably
less
than
in
the
full
grown
birds
.
Some
characteristic
points
of
difference
for
instance
,
that
of
the
width
of
mouth
could
hardly
be
detected
in
the
young
.
But
there
was
one
remarkable
exception
to
this
rule
,
for
the
young
of
the
short
faced
tumbler
differed
from
the
young
of
the
wild
rock
pigeon
and
of
the
other
breeds
,
in
almost
exactly
the
same
proportions
as
in
the
adult
state
.
These
facts
are
explained
by
the
above
two
principles
.
Fanciers
select
their
dogs
,
horses
,
pigeons
,
&c
.
,
for
breeding
,
when
nearly
grown
up
:
they
are
indifferent
whether
the
desired
qualities
are
acquired
earlier
or
later
in
life
,
if
the
full
grown
animal
possesses
them
.
And
the
cases
just
given
,
more
especially
that
of
the
pigeons
,
show
that
the
characteristic
differences
which
have
been
accumulated
by
man's
selection
,
and
which
give
value
to
his
breeds
,
do
not
generally
appear
at
a
very
early
period
of
life
,
and
are
inherited
at
a
corresponding
not
early
period
.
But
the
case
of
the
shortfaced
tumbler
,
which
when
twelve
hours
old
possessed
its
proper
characters
,
proves
that
this
is
not
the
universal
rule
;
for
here
the
characteristic
differences
must
either
have
appeared
at
an
earlier
period
than
usual
,
or
,
if
not
so
,
the
differences
must
have
been
inherited
,
not
at
a
corresponding
,
but
at
an
earlier
age
.
Now
let
us
apply
these
two
principles
to
species
in
a
state
of
nature
.
Let
us
take
a
group
of
birds
,
descended
from
some
ancient
form
and
modified
through
natural
selection
for
different
habits
.
Then
,
from
the
many
slight
successive
variations
having
supervened
in
the
several
species
at
a
not
early
age
,
and
having
been
inherited
at
a
corresponding
age
,
the
young
will
have
been
but
little
modified
,
and
they
will
still
resemble
each
other
much
more
closely
than
do
the
adults
,
just
as
we
have
seen
with
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
.
We
may
extend
this
view
to
widely
distinct
structures
and
to
whole
classes
.
The
fore
limbs
,
for
instance
,
which
once
served
as
legs
to
a
remote
progenitor
,
may
have
become
,
through
a
long
course
of
modification
,
adapted
in
one
descendant
to
act
as
hands
,
in
another
as
paddles
,
in
another
as
wings
;
but
on
the
above
two
principles
the
fore
limbs
will
not
have
been
much
modified
in
the
embryos
of
these
several
forms
;
although
in
each
form
the
fore
limb
will
differ
greatly
in
the
adult
state
.
Whatever
influence
long
continued
use
or
disuse
may
have
had
in
modifying
the
limbs
or
other
parts
of
any
species
,
this
will
chiefly
or
solely
have
affected
it
when
nearly
mature
,
when
it
was
compelled
to
use
its
full
powers
to
gain
its
own
living
;
and
the
effects
thus
produced
will
have
been
transmitted
to
the
offspring
at
a
corresponding
nearly
mature
age
.
Thus
the
young
will
not
be
modified
,
or
will
be
modified
only
in
a
slight
degree
,
through
the
effects
of
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
.
With
some
animals
the
successive
variations
may
have
supervened
at
a
very
early
period
of
life
,
or
the
steps
may
have
been
inherited
at
an
earlier
age
than
that
at
which
they
first
occurred
.
In
either
of
these
cases
,
the
young
or
embryo
will
closely
resemble
the
mature
parent
form
,
as
we
have
seen
with
the
short
faced
tumbler
.
And
this
is
the
rule
of
development
in
certain
whole
groups
,
or
in
certain
sub
groups
alone
,
as
with
cuttle
fish
,
land
shells
,
fresh
water
crustaceans
,
spiders
,
and
some
members
of
the
great
class
of
insects
.
With
respect
to
the
final
cause
of
the
young
in
such
groups
not
passing
through
any
metamorphosis
,
we
can
see
that
this
would
follow
from
the
following
contingencies
;
namely
,
from
the
young
having
to
provide
at
a
very
early
age
for
their
own
wants
,
and
from
their
following
the
same
habits
of
life
with
their
parents
;
for
in
this
case
,
it
would
be
indispensable
for
their
existence
that
they
should
be
modified
in
the
same
manner
as
their
parents
.
Again
,
with
respect
to
the
singular
fact
that
many
terrestrial
and
fresh
water
animals
do
not
undergo
any
metamorphosis
,
whilst
marine
members
of
the
same
groups
pass
through
various
transformations
,
Fritz
Muller
has
suggested
that
the
process
of
slowly
modifying
and
adapting
an
animal
to
live
on
the
land
or
in
fresh
water
,
instead
of
in
the
sea
,
would
be
greatly
simplified
by
its
not
passing
through
any
larval
stage
;
for
it
is
not
probable
that
places
well
adapted
for
both
the
larval
and
mature
stages
,
under
such
new
and
greatly
changed
habits
of
life
,
would
commonly
be
found
unoccupied
or
ill
occupied
by
other
organisms
.
In
this
case
the
gradual
acquirement
at
an
earlier
and
earlier
age
of
the
adult
structure
would
be
favoured
by
natural
selection
;
and
all
traces
of
former
metamorphoses
would
finally
be
lost
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
profited
the
young
of
an
animal
to
follow
habits
of
life
slightly
different
from
those
of
the
parent
form
,
and
consequently
to
be
constructed
on
a
slightly
different
plan
,
or
if
it
profited
a
larva
already
different
from
its
parent
to
change
still
further
,
then
,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
,
the
young
or
the
larvae
might
be
rendered
by
natural
selection
more
and
more
different
from
their
parents
to
any
conceivable
extent
.
Differences
in
the
larva
might
,
also
,
become
correlated
with
successive
stages
of
its
development
;
so
that
the
larva
,
in
the
first
stage
might
come
to
differ
greatly
from
the
larva
in
the
second
stage
,
as
is
the
case
with
many
animals
.
The
adult
might
also
become
fitted
for
sites
or
habits
,
in
which
organs
of
locomotion
or
of
the
senses
,
&c
.
,
would
be
useless
;
and
in
this
case
the
metamorphosis
would
be
retrograde
.
From
the
remarks
just
made
we
can
see
how
by
changes
of
structure
in
the
young
,
in
conformity
with
changed
habits
of
life
,
together
with
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
,
animals
might
come
to
pass
through
stages
of
development
,
perfectly
distinct
from
the
primordial
condition
of
their
adult
progenitors
.
Most
of
our
best
authorities
are
now
convinced
that
the
various
larval
and
pupal
stages
of
insects
have
thus
been
acquired
through
adaptation
,
and
not
through
inheritance
from
some
ancient
form
.
The
curious
case
of
Sitaris
a
beetle
which
passes
through
certain
unusual
stages
of
development
will
illustrate
how
this
might
occur
.
The
first
larval
form
is
described
by
M
.
Fabre
,
as
an
active
,
minute
insect
,
furnished
with
six
legs
,
two
long
antennae
,
and
four
eyes
.
These
larvae
are
hatched
in
the
nests
of
bees
;
and
when
the
male
bees
emerge
from
their
burrows
,
in
the
spring
,
which
they
do
before
the
females
,
the
larvae
spring
on
them
,
and
afterwards
crawl
on
to
the
females
whilst
paired
with
the
males
.
As
soon
as
the
female
bee
deposits
her
eggs
on
the
surface
of
the
honey
stored
in
the
cells
,
the
larvas
of
the
Sitaris
leap
on
the
eggs
and
devour
them
.
Afterwards
they
undergo
a
complete
change
;
their
eyes
disappear
;
their
legs
and
antennae
become
rudimentary
,
and
they
feed
on
honey
;
so
that
they
now
more
closely
resemble
the
ordinary
larvae
of
insects
;
ultimately
they
undergo
a
further
transformation
,
and
finally
emerge
as
the
perfect
beetle
.
Now
,
if
an
insect
,
undergoing
transformations
like
those
of
the
Sitaris
,
were
to
become
the
progenitor
of
a
whole
new
class
of
insects
,
the
course
of
development
of
the
new
class
would
be
widely
different
from
that
of
our
existing
insects
;
and
the
first
larval
stage
certainly
would
not
represent
the
former
condition
of
any
adult
and
ancient
form
.
On
the
other
hand
it
is
highly
probable
that
with
many
animals
the
embryonic
or
larval
stages
show
us
,
more
or
less
completely
,
the
condition
of
the
progenitor
of
the
whole
group
in
its
adult
state
.
In
the
great
class
of
the
Crustacea
,
forms
wonderfully
distinct
from
each
other
,
namely
,
suctorial
parasites
,
cirripedes
,
entomostraca
,
and
even
the
malacostraca
,
appear
at
first
as
larvae
under
the
nauplius
form
;
and
as
these
larvae
live
and
feed
in
the
open
sea
,
and
are
not
adapted
for
any
peculiar
habits
of
life
,
and
from
other
reasons
assigned
by
Fritz
Muller
it
is
probable
that
at
some
very
remote
period
an
independent
adult
animal
,
resembling
the
nauplius
,
existed
,
and
subsequently
produced
,
along
several
divergent
lines
of
descent
,
the
above
named
great
crustacean
groups
.
So
again
it
is
probable
,
from
what
we
know
of
the
embryos
of
mammals
,
birds
,
fishes
,
and
reptiles
,
that
these
animals
are
the
modified
descendants
of
some
ancient
progenitor
,
which
was
furnished
in
its
adult
state
with
branchiae
,
a
swimbladder
,
four
finlike
limbs
,
and
a
long
tail
,
all
fitted
for
an
aquatic
life
.
As
all
the
organic
beings
,
extinct
and
recent
,
which
have
ever
lived
,
can
be
arranged
within
a
few
great
classes
;
and
as
all
within
each
class
have
,
according
to
our
theory
,
been
connected
together
by
fine
gradations
,
the
best
,
and
,
if
our
collections
were
nearly
perfect
,
the
only
possible
arrangement
,
would
be
genealogical
;
descent
being
the
hidden
bond
of
connexion
which
naturalists
have
been
seeking
under
the
term
of
the
Natural
System
.
On
this
view
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
,
in
the
eyes
of
most
naturalists
,
the
structure
of
the
embryo
is
even
more
important
for
classification
than
that
of
the
adult
.
In
two
or
more
groups
of
animals
,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
structure
and
habits
in
their
adult
condition
,
if
they
pass
through
closely
similar
embryonic
stages
,
we
may
feel
assured
that
they
all
are
descended
from
one
parent
form
,
and
are
therefore
closely
related
.
Thus
,
community
in
embryonic
structure
reveals
community
of
descent
;
but
dissimilarity
in
embryonic
development
does
not
prove
discommunity
of
descent
,
for
in
one
of
two
groups
the
developmental
stages
may
have
been
suppressed
,
or
may
have
been
so
greatly
modified
through
adaptation
to
new
habits
of
life
,
as
to
be
no
longer
recognisable
.
Even
in
groups
,
in
which
the
adults
have
been
modified
to
an
extreme
degree
,
community
of
origin
is
often
revealed
by
the
structure
of
the
larvae
;
we
have
seen
,
for
instance
,
that
cirripedes
,
though
externally
so
like
shell
fish
,
are
at
once
known
by
their
larvae
to
belong
to
the
great
class
of
crustaceans
.
As
the
embryo
often
shows
us
more
or
less
plainly
the
structure
of
the
less
modified
and
ancient
progenitor
of
the
group
,
we
can
see
why
ancient
and
extinct
forms
so
resemble
in
their
adult
state
the
embryos
of
existing
species
of
the
same
class
.
Agassiz
believes
this
to
be
a
universal
law
of
nature
;
and
we
may
hope
hereafter
to
see
the
law
proved
true
.
It
can
,
however
,
be
proved
true
only
in
those
cases
in
which
the
ancient
state
of
the
progenitor
of
the
group
has
not
been
wholly
obliterated
,
either
by
successive
variations
having
supervened
at
a
very
early
period
of
growth
,
or
by
such
variations
having
been
inherited
at
an
earlier
age
than
that
at
which
they
first
appeared
.
It
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
,
that
the
law
may
be
true
,
but
yet
,
owing
to
the
geological
record
not
extending
far
enough
back
in
time
,
may
remain
for
a
long
period
,
or
for
ever
,
incapable
of
demonstration
.
The
law
will
not
strictly
hold
good
in
those
cases
in
which
an
ancient
form
became
adapted
in
its
larvae
state
to
some
special
line
of
life
,
and
transmitted
the
same
larval
state
to
a
whole
group
of
descendants
;
for
such
larvae
will
not
resemble
any
still
more
ancient
form
in
its
adult
state
.
Thus
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
the
leading
facts
in
embryology
,
which
are
second
to
none
in
importance
,
are
explained
on
the
principle
of
variations
in
the
many
descendants
from
some
one
ancient
progenitor
,
having
appeared
at
a
not
very
early
period
of
life
,
and
having
been
inherited
at
a
corresponding
period
.
Embryology
rises
greatly
in
interest
,
when
we
look
at
the
embryo
as
a
picture
,
more
or
less
obscured
,
of
the
progenitor
,
either
in
its
adult
or
larval
state
,
of
all
the
members
of
the
same
great
class
.
Rudimentary
,
Atrophied
,
and
Aborted
Organs
Organs
or
parts
in
this
strange
condition
,
bearing
the
plain
stamp
of
inutility
,
are
extremely
common
,
or
even
general
,
throughout
nature
.
It
would
be
impossible
to
name
one
of
the
higher
animals
in
which
some
part
or
other
is
not
in
a
rudimentary
condition
.
In
the
mammalia
,
for
instance
,
the
males
possess
rudimentary
mammae
;
in
snakes
one
lobe
of
the
lungs
is
rudimentary
;
in
birds
the
"
bastardwing
"
may
safely
be
considered
as
a
rudimentary
digit
,
and
in
some
species
the
whole
wing
is
so
far
rudimentary
that
it
cannot
be
used
for
flight
.
What
can
be
more
curious
than
the
presence
of
teeth
in
foetal
whales
,
which
when
grown
up
have
not
a
tooth
in
their
heads
;
or
the
teeth
,
which
never
cut
through
the
gums
,
in
the
upper
jaws
of
unborn
calves
?
Rudimentary
organs
plainly
declare
their
origin
and
meaning
in
various
ways
.
There
are
beetles
belonging
to
closely
allied
species
,
or
even
to
the
same
identical
species
,
which
have
either
full
sized
and
perfect
wings
,
or
mere
rudiments
of
membrane
,
which
not
rarely
lie
under
wing
covers
firmly
soldered
together
;
and
in
these
cases
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
,
that
the
rudiments
represent
wings
.
Rudimentary
organs
sometimes
retain
their
potentiality
:
this
occasionally
occurs
with
the
mammae
of
male
mammals
,
which
have
been
known
to
become
well
developed
and
to
secrete
milk
.
So
again
in
the
udders
in
the
genus
Bos
,
there
are
normally
four
developed
and
two
rudimentary
teats
;
but
the
latter
in
our
domestic
cows
sometimes
become
well
developed
and
yield
milk
.
In
regard
to
plants
the
petals
are
sometimes
rudimentary
,
and
sometimes
well
developed
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
.
In
certain
plants
having
separated
sexes
Kolreuter
found
that
by
crossing
a
species
,
in
which
the
male
flowers
included
a
rudiment
of
a
pistil
,
with
an
hermaphrodite
species
,
having
of
course
a
well
developed
pistil
,
the
rudiment
in
the
hybrid
offspring
was
much
increased
in
size
;
and
this
clearly
shows
that
the
rudimentary
and
perfect
pistils
are
essentially
alike
in
nature
.
An
animal
may
possess
various
parts
in
a
perfect
state
,
and
yet
they
may
in
one
sense
be
rudimentary
,
for
they
are
useless
:
thus
the
tadpole
of
the
common
salamander
or
water
newt
,
as
Mr
.
G
.
H
.
Lewes
remarks
,
"
has
gills
,
and
passes
its
existence
in
the
water
;
but
the
Salamandra
atra
,
which
lives
high
up
among
the
mountains
,
brings
forth
its
young
full
formed
.
This
animal
never
lives
in
the
water
.
Yet
if
we
open
a
gravid
female
,
we
find
tadpoles
inside
her
with
exquisitely
feathered
gills
;
and
when
placed
in
water
they
swim
about
like
the
tadpoles
of
the
water
newt
.
Obviously
this
aquatic
organisation
has
no
reference
to
the
future
life
of
the
animal
,
nor
has
it
any
adaptation
to
its
embryonic
condition
;
it
has
solely
reference
to
ancestral
adaptations
,
it
repeats
a
phase
in
the
development
of
its
progenitors
.
"
An
organ
,
serving
for
two
purposes
,
may
become
rudimentary
or
utterly
aborted
for
one
,
even
the
more
important
purpose
,
and
remain
perfectly
efficient
for
the
other
.
Thus
in
plants
,
the
office
of
the
pistil
is
to
allow
the
pollen
tubes
to
reach
the
ovules
within
the
ovarium
.
The
pistil
consists
of
a
stigma
supported
on
a
style
;
but
in
some
Compositae
,
the
male
florets
,
which
of
course
cannot
be
fecundated
,
have
a
rudimentary
pistil
,
for
it
is
not
crowned
with
a
stigma
;
but
the
style
remains
well
developed
and
is
clothed
in
the
usual
manner
with
hairs
,
which
serve
to
brush
the
pollen
out
of
the
surrounding
and
conjoined
anthers
.
Again
,
an
organ
may
become
rudimentary
for
its
proper
purpose
,
and
be
used
for
a
distinct
one
:
in
certain
fishes
the
swimbladder
seems
to
be
rudimentary
for
its
proper
function
of
giving
buoyancy
,
but
has
become
converted
into
a
nascent
breathing
organ
or
lung
.
Many
similar
instances
could
be
given
.
Useful
organs
,
however
little
they
may
be
developed
,
unless
we
have
reason
to
suppose
that
they
were
formerly
more
highly
developed
,
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
rudimentary
.
They
may
be
in
a
nascent
condition
,
and
in
progress
towards
further
development
.
Rudimentary
organs
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
either
quite
useless
,
such
as
teeth
which
never
cut
through
the
gums
,
or
almost
useless
,
such
as
the
wings
of
an
ostrich
,
which
serve
merely
as
sails
.
As
organs
in
this
condition
would
formerly
,
when
still
less
developed
,
have
been
of
even
less
use
than
at
present
,
they
cannot
formerly
have
been
produced
through
variation
and
natural
selection
,
which
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
useful
modifications
.
They
have
been
partially
retained
by
the
power
of
inheritance
,
and
relate
to
a
former
state
of
things
.
It
is
,
however
,
often
difficult
to
distinguish
between
rudimentary
and
nascent
organs
;
for
we
can
judge
only
by
analogy
whether
a
part
is
capable
of
further
development
,
in
which
case
alone
it
deserves
to
be
called
nascent
.
Organs
in
this
condition
will
always
be
somewhat
rare
;
for
beings
thus
provided
will
commonly
have
been
supplanted
by
their
successors
with
the
same
organ
in
a
more
perfect
state
,
and
consequently
will
have
become
long
ago
extinct
.
The
wing
of
the
penguin
is
of
high
service
,
acting
as
a
fin
;
it
may
,
therefore
,
represent
the
nascent
state
of
the
wing
:
not
that
I
believe
this
to
be
the
case
;
it
is
more
probably
a
reduced
organ
,
modified
for
a
new
function
:
the
wing
of
the
Apteryx
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
quite
useless
,
and
is
truly
rudimentary
.
Owen
considers
the
simple
filamentary
limbs
of
the
lepidosiren
as
the
"
beginnings
of
organs
which
attain
full
functional
development
in
higher
vertebrates
"
;
but
,
according
to
the
view
lately
advocated
by
Dr
.
Gunther
,
they
are
probably
remnants
,
consisting
of
the
persistent
axis
of
a
fin
,
with
the
lateral
rays
of
branches
aborted
.
The
mammary
glands
of
the
Ornithorhynchus
may
be
considered
,
in
comparison
with
the
udders
of
a
cow
,
as
in
a
nascent
condition
.
The
ovigerous
frena
of
certain
cirripedes
,
which
have
ceased
to
give
attachment
to
the
ova
and
are
feebly
developed
,
are
nascent
branchiae
.
Rudimentary
organs
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
very
liable
to
vary
in
the
degree
of
their
development
and
in
other
respects
.
In
closely
allied
species
,
also
,
the
extent
to
which
the
same
organ
has
been
reduced
occasionally
differs
much
.
This
latter
fact
is
well
exemplified
in
the
state
of
the
wings
of
female
moths
belonging
to
the
same
family
.
Rudimentary
organs
may
be
utterly
aborted
;
and
this
implies
,
that
in
certain
animals
or
plants
,
parts
are
entirely
absent
which
analogy
would
lead
us
to
expect
to
find
in
them
,
and
which
are
occasionally
found
in
monstrous
individuals
.
Thus
in
most
of
the
Scrophulariaceae
the
fifth
stamen
is
utterly
aborted
;
yet
we
may
conclude
that
a
fifth
stamen
once
existed
,
for
a
rudiment
of
it
is
found
in
many
species
of
the
family
,
and
this
rudiment
occasionally
becomes
perfectly
developed
,
as
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
the
common
snap
dragon
.
In
tracing
the
homologies
of
any
part
in
different
members
of
the
same
class
,
nothing
is
more
common
,
or
,
in
order
fully
to
understand
the
relations
of
the
parts
,
more
useful
than
the
discovery
of
rudiments
.
This
is
well
shown
in
the
drawings
given
by
Owen
of
the
leg
bones
of
the
horse
,
ox
,
and
rhinoceros
.
It
is
an
important
fact
that
rudimentary
organs
,
such
as
teeth
in
the
upper
jaws
of
whales
and
ruminants
,
can
often
be
detected
in
the
embryo
,
but
afterwards
wholly
disappear
.
It
is
also
,
I
believe
,
a
universal
rule
,
that
a
rudimentary
part
is
of
greater
size
in
the
embryo
relatively
to
the
adjoining
parts
,
than
in
the
adult
;
so
that
the
organ
at
this
early
age
is
less
rudimentary
,
or
even
cannot
be
said
to
be
in
any
degree
rudimentary
.
Hence
rudimentary
organs
in
the
adult
are
often
said
to
have
retained
their
embryonic
condition
.
I
have
now
given
the
leading
facts
with
respect
to
rudimentary
organs
.
In
reflecting
on
them
,
every
one
must
be
struck
with
astonishment
;
for
the
same
reasoning
power
which
tells
us
that
most
parts
and
organs
are
exquisitely
adapted
for
certain
purposes
,
tells
us
with
equal
plainness
that
these
rudimentary
or
atrophied
organs
are
imperfect
and
useless
.
In
works
on
natural
history
,
rudimentary
organs
are
generally
said
to
have
been
created
"
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
,
"
or
in
order
"
to
complete
the
scheme
of
nature
.
"
But
this
is
not
an
explanation
,
merely
a
re
statement
of
the
fact
.
Nor
is
it
consistent
with
itself
;
thus
the
boa
constrictor
has
rudiments
of
hind
limbs
and
of
a
pelvis
,
and
if
it
be
said
that
these
bones
have
been
retained
"
to
complete
the
scheme
of
nature
,
"
why
,
as
Professor
Weismann
asks
,
have
they
not
been
retained
by
other
snakes
,
which
do
not
possess
even
a
vestige
of
these
same
bones
?
What
would
be
thought
of
an
astronomer
who
maintained
that
the
satellites
revolve
in
elliptic
courses
round
their
planets
"
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
,
"
because
the
planets
thus
revolve
round
the
sun
?
An
eminent
physiologist
accounts
for
the
presence
of
rudimentary
organs
,
by
supposing
that
they
serve
to
excrete
matter
in
excess
,
or
matter
injurious
to
the
system
;
but
can
we
suppose
that
the
minute
papilla
,
which
often
represents
the
pistil
in
male
flowers
,
and
which
is
formed
of
mere
cellular
tissue
,
can
thus
act
?
Can
we
suppose
that
rudimentary
teeth
,
which
are
subsequently
absorbed
,
are
beneficial
to
the
rapidly
growing
embryonic
calf
by
removing
matter
so
precious
as
phosphate
of
lime
?
When
a
man's
fingers
have
been
amputated
,
imperfect
nails
have
been
known
to
appear
on
the
stumps
,
and
I
could
as
soon
believe
that
these
vestiges
of
nails
are
developed
in
order
to
excrete
horny
matter
,
as
that
the
rudimentary
nails
on
the
fin
of
the
manatee
have
been
developed
for
this
same
purpose
.
On
the
view
of
descent
with
modification
,
the
origin
of
rudimentary
organs
is
comparatively
simple
;
and
we
can
understand
to
a
large
extent
the
laws
governing
their
imperfect
development
.
We
have
plenty
of
cases
of
rudimentary
organs
in
our
domestic
productions
,
as
the
stump
of
a
tail
in
tailless
breeds
,
the
vestige
of
an
ear
in
earless
breeds
of
sheep
,
the
reappearance
of
minute
dangling
horns
in
hornless
breeds
of
cattle
,
more
especially
,
according
to
Youatt
,
in
young
animals
,
and
the
state
of
the
whole
flower
in
the
cauliflower
.
We
often
see
rudiments
of
various
parts
in
monsters
;
but
I
doubt
whether
any
of
these
cases
throw
light
on
the
origin
of
rudimentary
organs
in
a
state
of
nature
,
further
than
by
showing
that
rudiments
can
be
produced
;
for
the
balance
of
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
species
under
nature
do
not
undergo
great
and
abrupt
changes
.
But
we
learn
from
the
study
of
our
domestic
productions
that
the
disuse
of
parts
leads
to
their
reduced
size
;
and
that
the
result
is
inherited
.
It
appears
probable
that
disuse
has
been
the
main
agent
in
rendering
organs
rudimentary
.
It
would
at
first
lead
by
slow
steps
to
the
more
and
more
complete
reduction
of
a
part
,
until
at
last
it
became
rudimentary
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
eyes
of
animals
inhabiting
dark
caverns
,
and
of
the
wings
of
birds
inhabiting
oceanic
islands
,
which
have
seldom
been
forced
by
beasts
of
prey
to
take
flight
,
and
have
ultimately
lost
the
power
of
flying
.
Again
,
an
organ
,
useful
under
certain
conditions
,
might
become
injurious
under
others
,
as
with
the
wings
of
beetles
living
on
small
and
exposed
islands
;
and
in
this
case
natural
selection
will
have
aided
in
reducing
the
organ
,
until
it
was
rendered
harmless
and
rudimentary
.
Any
change
in
structure
and
function
,
which
can
be
effected
by
small
stages
,
is
within
the
power
of
natural
selection
;
so
that
an
organ
rendered
,
through
changed
habits
of
life
,
useless
or
injurious
for
one
purpose
,
might
be
modified
