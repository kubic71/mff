WHEN
on
board
H
.
M
.
S
.
Beagle
as
naturalist
,
I
was
much
struck
with
certain
facts
in
the
distribution
of
the
organic
beings
inhabiting
South
America
,
and
in
the
geological
relations
of
the
present
to
the
past
inhabitants
of
that
continent
.
These
facts
,
as
will
be
seen
in
the
latter
chapters
of
this
volume
,
seemed
to
throw
some
light
on
the
origin
of
species
that
mystery
of
mysteries
,
as
it
has
been
called
by
one
of
our
greatest
philosophers
.
On
my
return
home
,
it
occurred
to
me
,
in
1837
,
that
something
might
perhaps
be
made
out
on
this
question
by
patiently
accumulating
and
reflecting
on
all
sorts
of
facts
which
could
possibly
have
any
bearing
on
it
.
After
five
years'
work
I
allowed
myself
to
speculate
on
the
subject
,
and
drew
up
some
short
notes
;
these
I
enlarged
in
1844
into
a
sketch
of
the
conclusions
,
which
then
seemed
to
me
probable
:
from
that
period
to
the
present
day
I
have
steadily
pursued
the
same
object
.
I
hope
that
I
may
be
excused
for
entering
on
these
personal
details
,
as
I
give
them
to
show
that
I
have
not
been
hasty
in
coming
to
a
decision
.
My
work
is
now
(
1859
)
nearly
finished
;
but
as
it
will
take
me
many
more
years
to
complete
it
,
and
as
my
health
is
far
from
strong
,
I
have
been
urged
to
publish
this
abstract
.
I
have
more
especially
been
induced
to
do
this
,
as
Mr
.
Wallace
,
who
is
now
studying
the
natural
history
of
the
Malay
Archipelago
,
has
arrived
at
almost
exactly
the
same
general
conclusions
that
I
have
on
the
origin
of
species
.
In
1858
he
sent
me
a
memoir
on
this
subject
,
with
a
request
that
I
would
forward
it
to
Sir
Charles
Lyell
,
who
sent
it
to
the
Linnean
Society
,
and
it
is
published
in
the
third
volume
of
the
Journal
of
that
society
.
Sir
C
.
Lyell
and
Dr
.
Hooker
,
who
both
knew
of
my
work
the
latter
having
read
my
sketch
of
1844
honoured
me
by
thinking
it
advisable
to
publish
,
with
Mr
.
Wallace's
excellent
memoir
,
some
brief
extracts
from
my
manuscripts
.
This
abstract
,
which
I
now
publish
,
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
.
cannot
here
give
references
and
authorities
for
my
several
statements
;
and
I
must
trust
to
the
reader
reposing
some
confidence
in
my
accuracy
.
No
doubt
errors
will
have
crept
in
,
though
I
hope
I
have
always
been
cautious
in
trusting
to
good
authorities
alone
.
I
can
here
give
only
the
general
conclusions
at
which
I
have
arrived
,
with
a
few
facts
in
illustration
,
but
which
,
I
hope
,
in
most
cases
will
suffice
.
No
one
can
feel
more
sensible
than
I
do
of
the
necessity
of
hereafter
publishing
in
detail
all
the
facts
,
with
references
,
on
which
my
conclusions
have
been
grounded
;
and
I
hope
in
a
future
work
to
do
this
.
For
I
am
well
aware
that
scarcely
a
single
point
is
discussed
in
this
volume
on
which
facts
cannot
be
adduced
,
often
apparently
leading
to
conclusions
directly
opposite
to
those
at
which
I
have
arrived
.
A
fair
result
can
be
obtained
only
by
fully
stating
and
balancing
the
facts
and
arguments
on
both
sides
of
each
question
;
and
this
is
here
impossible
.
I
much
regret
that
want
of
space
prevents
my
having
the
satisfaction
of
acknowledging
the
generous
assistance
which
I
have
received
from
very
many
naturalists
,
some
of
them
personally
unknown
to
me
.
I
cannot
,
however
,
let
this
opportunity
pass
without
expressing
my
deep
obligations
to
Dr
.
Hooker
,
who
,
for
the
last
fifteen
years
,
has
aided
me
in
every
possible
way
by
his
large
stores
of
knowledge
and
his
excellent
judgment
.
In
considering
the
Origin
of
Species
,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
naturalist
,
reflecting
on
the
mutual
affinities
of
organic
beings
,
on
their
embryological
relations
,
their
geographical
distribution
,
geological
succession
,
and
other
such
facts
,
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
species
had
not
been
independently
created
,
but
had
descended
,
like
varieties
,
from
other
species
.
Nevertheless
,
such
a
conclusion
,
even
if
well
founded
,
would
be
unsatisfactory
,
until
it
could
be
shown
how
the
innumerable
species
inhabiting
this
world
have
been
modified
,
so
as
to
acquire
that
perfection
of
structure
and
coadaptation
which
justly
excites
our
admiration
.
Naturalists
continually
refer
to
external
conditions
,
such
as
climate
,
food
,
&c
.
,
as
the
only
possible
cause
of
variation
.
In
one
limited
sense
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
this
may
be
true
;
but
it
is
preposterous
to
attribute
to
mere
external
conditions
,
the
structure
,
for
instance
,
of
the
woodpecker
,
with
its
feet
,
tail
,
beak
,
and
tongue
,
so
admirably
adapted
to
catch
insects
under
the
bark
of
trees
.
In
the
case
of
the
mistletoe
,
which
draws
its
nourishment
from
certain
trees
,
which
has
seeds
that
must
be
transported
by
certain
birds
,
and
which
has
flowers
with
separate
sexes
absolutely
requiring
the
agency
of
certain
insects
to
bring
pollen
from
one
flower
to
the
other
,
it
is
equally
preposterous
to
account
for
the
structure
of
this
parasite
,
with
its
relations
to
several
distinct
organic
beings
,
by
the
effects
of
external
conditions
,
or
of
habit
,
or
of
the
volition
of
the
plant
itself
.
It
is
,
therefore
,
of
the
highest
importance
to
gain
a
clear
insight
into
the
means
of
modification
and
coadaptation
.
At
the
commencement
of
my
observations
it
seemed
to
me
probable
that
a
careful
study
of
domesticated
animals
and
of
cultivated
plants
would
offer
the
best
chance
of
making
out
this
obscure
problem
.
Nor
have
I
been
disappointed
;
in
this
and
in
all
other
perplexing
cases
I
have
invariably
found
that
our
knowledge
,
imperfect
though
it
be
,
of
variation
under
domestication
,
afforded
the
best
and
safest
clue
.
I
may
venture
to
express
my
conviction
of
the
high
value
of
such
studies
,
although
they
have
been
very
commonly
neglected
by
naturalists
.
From
these
considerations
,
I
shall
devote
the
first
chapter
of
this
Abstract
to
Variation
under
Domestication
.
We
shall
thus
see
that
a
large
amount
of
hereditary
modification
is
at
least
possible
;
and
,
what
is
equally
or
more
important
,
we
shall
see
how
great
is
the
power
of
man
in
accumulating
by
his
Selection
successive
slight
variations
.
I
will
then
pass
on
to
the
variability
of
species
in
a
state
of
nature
;
but
I
shall
,
unfortunately
,
be
compelled
to
treat
this
subject
far
too
briefly
,
as
it
can
be
treated
properly
only
by
giving
long
catalogues
of
facts
.
We
shall
,
however
,
be
enabled
to
discuss
what
circumstances
are
most
favourable
to
variation
.
In
the
next
chapter
the
Struggle
for
Existence
amongst
all
organic
beings
throughout
the
world
,
which
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
geometrical
ratio
of
their
increase
,
will
be
considered
.
This
is
the
doctrine
of
Malthus
,
applied
to
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
.
As
many
more
individuals
of
each
species
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
;
and
as
,
consequently
,
there
is
a
frequently
recurring
struggle
for
existence
,
it
follows
that
any
being
,
if
it
vary
however
slightly
in
any
manner
profitable
to
itself
,
under
the
complex
and
sometimes
varying
conditions
of
life
,
will
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
,
and
thus
be
naturally
selected
.
From
the
strong
principle
of
inheritance
,
any
selected
variety
will
tend
to
propagate
its
new
and
modified
form
.
This
fundamental
subject
of
Natural
Selection
will
be
treated
at
some
length
in
the
fourth
chapter
;
and
we
shall
then
see
how
Natural
Selection
almost
inevitably
causes
much
Extinction
of
the
less
improved
forms
of
life
,
and
leads
to
what
I
have
called
Divergence
of
Character
.
In
the
next
chapter
I
shall
discuss
the
complex
and
little
known
laws
of
variation
.
In
the
five
succeeding
chapters
,
the
most
apparent
and
gravest
difficulties
in
accepting
the
theory
will
be
given
:
namely
,
first
,
the
difficulties
of
transitions
,
or
how
a
simple
being
or
a
simple
organ
can
be
changed
and
perfected
into
a
highly
developed
being
or
into
an
elaborately
constructed
organ
;
secondly
,
the
subject
of
Instinct
,
or
the
mental
powers
of
animals
;
thirdly
,
Hybridism
,
or
the
infertility
of
species
and
the
fertility
of
varieties
when
intercrossed
;
and
fourthly
,
the
imperfection
of
the
Geological
Record
.
In
the
next
chapter
I
shall
consider
the
geological
succession
of
organic
beings
throughout
time
;
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
,
their
geographical
distribution
throughout
space
;
in
the
fourteenth
,
their
classification
or
mutual
affinities
,
both
when
mature
and
in
an
embryonic
condition
.
In
the
last
chapter
I
shall
give
a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
whole
work
,
and
a
few
concluding
remarks
.
No
one
ought
to
feel
surprise
at
much
remaining
as
yet
unexplained
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
species
and
varieties
,
if
he
make
due
allowance
for
our
profound
ignorance
in
regard
to
the
mutual
relations
of
the
many
beings
which
live
around
us
.
Who
can
explain
why
one
species
ranges
widely
and
is
very
numerous
,
and
why
another
allied
species
has
a
narrow
range
and
is
rare
?
Yet
these
relations
are
of
the
highest
importance
,
for
they
determine
the
present
welfare
and
,
as
I
believe
,
the
future
success
and
modification
of
every
inhabitant
of
this
world
.
Still
less
do
we
know
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
innumerable
inhabitants
of
the
world
during
the
many
past
geological
epochs
in
its
history
.
Although
much
remains
obscure
,
and
will
long
remain
obscure
,
I
can
entertain
no
doubt
,
after
the
most
deliberate
study
and
dispassionate
judgment
of
which
I
am
capable
,
that
the
view
which
most
naturalists
until
recently
entertained
,
and
which
I
formerly
entertained
namely
,
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
is
erroneous
.
I
am
fully
convinced
that
species
are
not
immutable
;
but
that
those
belonging
to
what
are
called
the
same
genera
are
lineal
descendants
of
some
other
and
generally
extinct
species
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
acknowledged
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
the
descendants
of
that
species
.
Furthermore
,
I
am
convinced
that
Natural
Selection
has
been
the
most
important
,
but
not
the
exclusive
,
means
of
modification
.
CHAPTER
I
VARIATION
UNDER
DOMESTICATION
Causes
of
Variability
WHEN
we
compare
the
individuals
of
the
same
variety
or
sub
variety
of
our
older
cultivated
plants
and
animals
,
one
of
the
first
points
which
strikes
us
is
,
that
they
generally
differ
more
from
each
other
than
do
the
individuals
of
any
one
species
or
variety
in
a
state
of
nature
.
And
if
we
reflect
on
the
vast
diversity
of
the
plants
and
animals
which
have
been
cultivated
,
and
which
have
varied
during
all
ages
under
the
most
different
climates
and
treatment
,
we
are
driven
to
conclude
that
this
great
variability
is
due
to
our
domestic
productions
having
been
raised
under
conditions
of
life
not
so
uniform
as
,
and
somewhat
different
from
,
those
to
which
the
parent
species
had
been
exposed
under
nature
.
There
is
,
also
,
some
probability
in
the
view
propounded
by
Andrew
Knight
,
that
this
variability
may
be
partly
connected
with
excess
of
food
.
It
seems
clear
that
organic
beings
must
be
exposed
during
several
generations
to
new
conditions
to
cause
any
great
amount
of
variation
;
and
that
,
when
the
organisation
has
once
begun
to
vary
,
it
generally
continues
varying
for
many
generations
.
No
case
is
on
record
of
a
variable
organism
ceasing
to
vary
under
cultivation
.
Our
oldest
cultivated
plants
,
such
as
wheat
,
still
yield
new
varieties
:
our
oldest
,
domesticated
animals
are
still
capable
of
rapid
improvement
or
modification
.
As
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
,
after
long
attending
to
the
subject
,
the
conditions
of
life
appear
to
act
in
two
ways
,
directly
on
the
whole
organisation
or
on
certain
parts
alone
,
and
indirectly
by
affecting
the
reproductive
system
.
With
respect
to
the
direct
action
,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
every
case
,
as
Professor
Weismann
has
lately
insisted
,
and
as
I
have
incidentally
shown
in
my
work
on
Variation
under
Domestication
,
there
are
two
factors
:
namely
,
the
nature
of
the
organism
,
and
the
nature
of
the
conditions
.
The
former
seems
to
be
much
the
more
important
;
for
nearly
similar
variations
sometimes
arise
under
,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
,
dissimilar
conditions
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
dissimilar
variations
arise
under
conditions
which
appear
to
be
nearly
uniform
.
The
effects
on
the
offspring
are
either
definite
or
indefinite
.
They
may
be
considered
as
definite
when
all
or
nearly
all
the
offspring
of
individuals
exposed
to
certain
conditions
during
several
generations
are
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
It
is
extremely
difficult
to
come
to
any
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
extent
of
the
changes
which
have
been
thus
definitely
induced
.
There
can
,
however
,
be
little
doubt
about
many
slight
changes
,
such
as
size
from
the
amount
of
food
,
colour
from
the
nature
of
the
food
,
thickness
of
the
skin
and
hair
from
climate
,
&c
.
Each
of
the
endless
variations
which
we
see
in
the
plumage
of
our
fowls
must
have
had
some
efficient
cause
;
and
if
the
same
cause
were
to
act
uniformly
during
a
long
series
of
generations
on
.
many
individuals
,
all
probably
would
be
modified
in
the
same
manner
.
Such
facts
as
the
complex
and
extraordinary
out
growths
which
variably
follow
from
the
insertion
of
a
minute
drop
of
poison
by
a
gall
producing
insect
,
show
us
what
singular
modifications
might
result
in
the
case
of
plants
from
a
chemical
change
in
the
nature
of
the
sap
.
Indefinite
variability
is
a
much
more
common
result
of
changed
conditions
than
definite
variability
,
and
has
probably
played
a
more
important
part
in
the
formation
of
our
domestic
races
.
We
see
indefinite
variability
in
the
endless
slight
peculiarities
which
distinguish
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
and
which
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
inheritance
from
either
parent
or
from
some
more
remote
ancestor
.
Even
strongly
marked
differences
occasionally
appear
in
the
young
of
the
same
litter
,
and
in
seedlings
from
the
same
seed
capsule
.
At
long
intervals
of
time
,
out
of
millions
of
individuals
reared
in
the
same
country
and
fed
on
nearly
the
same
food
,
deviations
of
structure
so
strongly
pronounced
as
to
deserve
to
be
called
monstrosities
arise
;
but
monstrosities
cannot
be
separated
by
any
distinct
line
from
slighter
variations
.
All
such
changes
of
structure
,
whether
extremely
slight
or
strongly
marked
,
which
appear
amongst
many
individuals
living
together
,
may
be
considered
as
the
indefinite
effects
of
the
conditions
of
life
on
each
individual
organism
,
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
the
chill
affects
different
men
in
an
indefinite
manner
,
according
to
their
state
of
body
or
constitution
,
causing
coughs
or
colds
,
rheumatism
,
or
inflammation
of
various
organs
.
With
respect
to
what
I
have
called
the
indirect
action
of
changed
conditions
,
namely
,
through
the
reproductive
system
of
being
affected
,
we
may
infer
that
variability
is
thus
induced
,
partly
from
the
fact
of
this
system
being
extremely
sensitive
to
any
change
in
the
conditions
,
and
partly
from
the
similarity
,
as
Kreuter
and
others
have
remarked
,
between
the
variability
which
follows
from
the
crossing
of
distinct
species
,
and
that
which
may
be
observed
with
plants
and
animals
when
reared
under
new
or
unnatural
conditions
.
Many
facts
clearly
show
how
eminently
susceptible
the
reproductive
system
is
to
very
slight
changes
in
the
surrounding
conditions
.
Nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
tame
an
animal
,
and
few
things
more
difficult
than
to
get
it
to
breed
freely
under
confinement
,
even
when
the
male
and
female
unite
.
How
many
animals
there
are
which
will
not
breed
,
though
kept
in
an
almost
free
state
in
their
native
country!
This
is
generally
,
but
erroneously
,
attributed
to
vitiated
instincts
.
Many
cultivated
plants
display
the
utmost
vigour
,
and
yet
rarely
or
never
seed!
In
some
few
cases
it
has
been
discovered
that
a
very
trifling
change
,
such
as
a
little
more
or
less
water
at
some
particular
period
of
growth
,
will
determine
whether
or
not
a
plant
will
produce
seeds
.
I
cannot
here
give
the
details
which
I
have
collected
and
elsewhere
published
on
this
curious
subject
;
but
to
show
how
singular
the
laws
are
which
determine
the
reproduction
of
animals
under
confinement
,
I
may
mention
that
carnivorous
animals
,
even
from
the
tropics
,
breed
in
this
country
pretty
freely
under
confinement
,
with
the
exception
of
the
plantigrades
or
bear
family
,
which
seldom
produce
young
;
whereas
carnivorous
birds
,
with
the
rarest
exceptions
,
hardly
ever
lay
fertile
eggs
.
Many
exotic
plants
have
pollen
utterly
worthless
,
in
the
same
condition
as
in
the
most
sterile
hybrids
.
When
,
on
the
one
hand
,
we
see
domesticated
animals
and
plants
,
though
often
weak
and
sickly
,
breeding
freely
under
confinement
;
and
when
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
see
individuals
,
though
taken
young
from
a
state
of
nature
perfectly
tamed
,
long
lived
and
healthy
(
of
which
I
could
give
numerous
instances
)
,
yet
having
their
reproductive
system
so
seriously
affected
by
unperceived
causes
as
to
fail
to
act
,
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
system
,
when
it
does
act
under
confinement
,
acting
irregularly
,
and
producing
offspring
somewhat
unlike
their
parents
.
I
may
add
,
that
as
some
organisms
breed
freely
under
the
most
unnatural
conditions
(
for
instance
,
rabbits
and
ferrets
kept
in
hutches
)
,
showing
that
their
reproductive
organs
are
not
easily
affected
;
so
will
some
animals
and
plants
withstand
domestication
or
cultivation
,
and
vary
very
slightly
perhaps
hardly
more
than
in
a
state
of
nature
.
Some
naturalists
have
maintained
that
all
variations
are
connected
with
the
act
of
sexual
reproduction
;
but
this
is
certainly
an
error
;
for
I
have
given
in
another
work
a
long
list
of
"
sporting
plants
,
"
as
they
are
called
by
gardeners
;
that
is
,
of
plants
which
have
suddenly
produced
a
single
bud
with
a
new
and
sometimes
widely
different
character
from
that
of
the
other
buds
on
the
same
plant
.
These
bud
variations
,
as
they
may
be
named
,
can
be
propagated
by
grafts
,
offsets
,
&c
.
,
and
sometimes
by
seed
.
They
occur
rarely
under
nature
,
but
are
far
from
rare
under
culture
.
As
a
single
bud
out
of
the
many
thousands
,
produced
year
after
year
on
the
same
tree
under
uniform
conditions
,
has
been
known
suddenly
to
assume
a
new
character
;
and
as
buds
on
distinct
trees
,
growing
under
different
conditions
,
have
sometimes
yielded
nearly
the
same
variety
for
instance
,
buds
on
peach
trees
producing
nectarines
,
and
buds
on
common
roses
producing
moss
roses
we
clearly
see
that
the
nature
of
the
conditions
is
of
subordinate
importance
in
comparison
with
the
nature
of
the
organism
in
determining
each
particular
form
of
variation
;
perhaps
of
not
more
importance
than
the
nature
of
the
spark
,
by
which
a
mass
of
combustible
matter
is
ignited
,
has
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
flames
.
Effects
of
Habit
and
of
the
Use
or
Disuse
of
Parts
;
Correlated
Variation
;
Inheritance
Changed
habits
produce
an
inherited
effect
,
as
in
the
period
of
the
flowering
of
plants
when
transported
from
one
climate
to
another
.
With
animals
the
increased
use
or
disuse
of
parts
has
had
a
more
marked
influence
;
thus
I
find
in
the
domestic
duck
that
the
bones
of
the
wing
weigh
less
and
the
bones
of
the
leg
more
,
in
proportion
to
the
whole
skeleton
,
than
do
the
same
bones
in
the
wild
duck
;
and
this
change
may
be
safely
attributed
to
the
domestic
duck
flying
much
less
,
and
walking
more
,
than
its
wild
parents
.
The
great
and
inherited
development
of
the
udders
in
cows
and
goats
in
countries
where
they
are
habitually
milked
,
in
comparison
with
these
organs
in
other
countries
,
is
probably
another
instance
of
the
effects
of
use
.
Not
one
of
our
domestic
animals
can
be
named
which
has
not
in
some
country
drooping
ears
;
and
the
view
which
has
been
suggested
that
the
drooping
is
due
to
disuse
of
the
muscles
of
the
ear
,
from
the
animals
being
seldom
much
alarmed
,
seems
probable
.
Many
laws
regulate
variation
,
some
few
of
which
can
be
dimly
seen
,
and
will
hereafter
be
briefly
discussed
.
I
will
here
only
allude
to
what
may
be
called
correlated
variation
.
Important
changes
in
the
embryo
or
larva
will
probably
entail
changes
in
the
mature
animal
.
In
monstrosities
,
the
correlations
between
quite
distinct
parts
are
very
curious
;
and
many
instances
are
given
in
Isidore
Geoffroy
St
Hilaire's
great
work
on
this
subject
.
Breeders
believe
that
long
limbs
are
almost
always
accompanied
by
an
elongated
head
.
Some
instances
of
correlation
are
quite
whimsical
:
thus
cats
which
are
entirely
white
and
have
blue
eyes
are
generally
deaf
;
but
it
has
been
lately
stated
by
Mr
.
Tait
that
this
is
confined
to
the
males
.
Colour
and
constitutional
peculiarities
go
together
,
of
which
many
remarkable
cases
could
be
given
amongst
animals
and
plants
.
From
facts
collected
by
Heusinger
,
it
appears
that
white
sheep
and
pigs
are
injured
by
certain
plants
,
whilst
dark
coloured
individuals
escape
:
Professor
Wyman
has
recently
communicated
to
me
a
good
illustration
of
this
fact
;
on
asking
some
farmers
in
Virginia
how
it
was
that
all
their
pigs
were
black
,
they
informed
him
that
the
pigs
ate
the
paint
root
(
Lachnanthes
)
,
which
coloured
their
bones
pink
,
and
which
caused
the
hoofs
of
all
but
the
black
varieties
to
drop
off
;
and
one
of
the
"
crackers
"
(
i
.
e
.
Virginia
squatters
)
added
,
"
we
select
the
black
members
of
a
litter
for
raising
,
as
they
alone
have
a
good
chance
of
living
.
"
Hairless
dogs
have
imperfect
teeth
;
long
haired
and
coarse
haired
animals
are
apt
to
have
,
as
is
asserted
,
long
or
many
horns
;
pigeons
with
feathered
feet
have
skin
between
their
outer
toes
;
pigeons
with
short
beaks
have
small
feet
,
and
those
with
long
beaks
large
feet
.
Hence
if
man
goes
on
selecting
,
and
thus
augmenting
,
any
peculiarity
,
he
will
almost
certainly
modify
unintentionally
other
parts
of
the
structure
,
owing
to
the
mysterious
laws
of
correlation
.
The
results
of
the
various
,
unknown
,
or
but
dimly
understood
laws
of
variation
are
infinitely
complex
and
diversified
.
It
is
well
worth
while
carefully
to
study
the
several
treatises
on
some
of
our
old
cultivated
plants
,
as
on
the
hyacinth
,
potato
,
even
the
dahlia
,
&c
.
;
and
it
is
really
surprising
to
note
the
endless
points
of
structure
and
constitution
in
which
the
varieties
and
sub
varieties
differ
slightly
from
each
other
.
The
whole
organisation
seems
to
have
become
plastic
,
and
departs
in
a
slight
degree
from
that
of
the
parental
type
.
Any
variation
which
is
not
inherited
is
unimportant
for
us
.
But
the
number
and
diversity
of
inheritable
deviations
of
structure
,
both
those
of
slight
and
those
of
considerable
physiological
importance
,
are
endless
.
Dr
.
Prosper
Lucas's
treatise
,
in
two
large
volumes
,
is
the
fullest
and
the
best
on
this
subject
.
No
breeder
doubts
how
strong
is
the
tendency
to
inheritance
;
that
like
produces
like
is
his
fundamental
belief
:
doubts
have
been
thrown
on
this
principle
only
by
theoretical
writers
.
When
any
deviation
of
structure
often
appears
,
and
we
see
it
in
the
father
and
child
,
we
cannot
tell
whether
it
may
not
be
due
to
the
same
cause
having
acted
on
both
;
but
when
amongst
individuals
,
apparently
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
,
any
very
rare
deviation
,
due
to
some
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances
,
appears
in
the
parent
say
,
once
amongst
several
million
individuals
and
it
reappears
in
the
child
,
the
mere
doctrine
of
chances
almost
compels
us
to
attribute
its
reappearance
to
inheritance
.
Every
one
must
have
heard
of
cases
of
albinism
,
prickly
skin
,
hairy
bodies
,
&c
.
,
appearing
in
several
members
of
the
same
family
.
If
strange
and
rare
deviations
of
structure
are
really
inherited
,
less
strange
and
commoner
deviations
may
be
freely
admitted
to
be
inheritable
.
Perhaps
the
correct
way
of
viewing
the
whole
subject
would
be
,
to
look
at
the
inheritance
of
every
character
whatever
as
the
rule
,
and
non
inheritance
as
the
anomaly
?
The
laws
governing
inheritance
are
for
the
most
part
unknown
.
No
one
can
say
why
the
same
peculiarity
in
different
individuals
of
the
same
species
,
or
in
different
species
,
is
sometimes
inherited
and
sometimes
not
so
;
why
the
child
often
reverts
in
certain
characters
to
its
grandfather
or
grandmother
or
more
remote
ancestor
;
why
a
peculiarity
is
often
transmitted
from
one
sex
to
both
sexes
,
or
to
one
sex
alone
,
more
commonly
but
not
exclusively
to
the
like
sex
.
It
is
a
fact
of
some
importance
to
us
,
that
peculiarities
appearing
in
the
males
of
our
domestic
breeds
are
often
transmitted
,
either
exclusively
or
in
a
much
greater
degree
,
to
the
males
alone
.
A
much
more
important
rule
,
which
I
think
may
be
trusted
,
is
that
,
at
whatever
period
of
life
a
peculiarity
first
appears
,
it
tends
to
reappear
in
the
offspring
at
a
corresponding
age
,
though
sometimes
earlier
.
In
many
cases
this
could
not
be
otherwise
;
thus
the
inherited
peculiarities
in
the
horns
of
cattle
could
appear
only
in
the
offspring
when
nearly
mature
;
peculiarities
in
the
silkworm
are
known
to
appear
at
the
corresponding
caterpillar
or
cocoon
stage
.
But
hereditary
diseases
and
some
other
facts
make
me
believe
that
the
rule
has
a
wider
extension
,
and
that
,
when
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
a
peculiarity
should
appear
at
any
particular
age
,
yet
that
it
does
tend
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period
at
which
it
first
appeared
in
the
parent
.
I
believe
this
rule
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
in
explaining
the
laws
of
embryology
.
These
remarks
are
of
course
confined
to
the
first
appearance
of
the
peculiarity
,
and
not
to
the
primary
cause
which
may
have
acted
on
the
ovules
or
on
the
male
element
;
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
the
increased
length
of
the
horns
in
the
offspring
from
a
short
horned
cow
by
a
long
horned
bull
,
though
appearing
late
in
life
,
is
clearly
due
to
the
male
element
.
Having
alluded
to
the
subject
of
reversion
,
I
may
here
refer
to
a
statement
often
made
by
naturalists
namely
,
that
our
domestic
varieties
,
when
run
wild
,
gradually
but
invariably
revert
in
character
to
their
aboriginal
stocks
.
Hence
it
has
been
argued
that
no
deductions
can
be
drawn
from
domestic
races
to
species
in
a
state
of
nature
.
I
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
discover
on
what
decisive
facts
the
above
statement
has
so
often
and
so
boldly
been
made
.
There
would
be
great
difficulty
in
proving
its
truth
:
we
may
safely
conclude
that
very
many
of
the
most
strongly
marked
domestic
varieties
could
not
possibly
live
in
a
wild
state
.
In
many
cases
,
we
do
not
know
what
the
aboriginal
stock
was
,
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
nearly
perfect
reversion
had
ensued
.
It
would
be
necessary
,
in
order
to
prevent
the
effects
of
intercrossing
,
that
only
a
single
variety
should
have
been
turned
loose
in
its
new
home
.
Nevertheless
,
as
our
varieties
certainly
do
occasionally
revert
in
some
of
their
characters
to
ancestral
forms
,
it
seems
to
me
not
improbable
that
if
we
could
succeed
in
naturalising
,
or
were
to
cultivate
,
during
many
generations
,
the
several
races
,
for
instance
,
of
the
cabbage
,
in
very
poor
soil
(
in
which
case
,
however
,
some
effect
would
have
to
be
attributed
to
the
definite
action
of
the
poor
soil
)
,
that
they
would
,
to
a
large
extent
,
or
even
wholly
,
revert
